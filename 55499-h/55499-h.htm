<p class="newpage center bold in0"><span class="xlarge">PREFATORY NOTE.</span></p>


<p>This monograph on the intellectual development of the Dominion
was delivered in substance as the presidential address to
the Royal Society of Canada at its May meeting of 1893, in
Ottawa. Since then the author has given the whole subject a
careful revision, and added a number of bibliographical and other
literary notes which could not conveniently appear in the text
of the address, but are likely to interest those who wish to follow
more closely the progress of culture in a country still struggling
with the difficulties of the material development of half a continent.
This little volume, as the title page shows, is intended as
the commencement of a series of historical and other essays
which will be periodically reproduced, in this more convenient
form for the general reader, from the large quarto volumes of the
Royal Society of Canada, where they first appear.</p>

<p class="hang p1b">A short review of the origin and history of the Royal Society of Canada; its aim, the
encouragement of the literature of learning and science, and of original ethnographical,
arch&#230;ological, historic and scientific investigation; desirous of
stimulating broad literary criticism; associated with all other Canadian societies
engaged in the same work; the wide circulation of its Transactions throughout
the world; the need of a magazine of a high class in Canada.</p>

of large private collections of paintings; meritorious work of O'Brien, Reed,
Peel, Pinhey, Forster and others; establishment of the Canadian Academy by
the Princess Louise and the Marquess of Lorne; necessity for greater encouragement
of native artists; success of Canadian artists at the World's Fair;
architecture in Canada imitative and not creative; the White City at Chicago
an illustration of the triumph of intellectual and artistic effort over the spirit
of mere materialism; its effect probably the development of a higher culture
and creative artistic genius on the continent.</p>

<p class="in0 center">XI.&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>.</p>

<p class="hang">Conclusion: The French language and its probable duration in Canada; the advantages
of a friendly rivalry among French and English Canadians, which will
best stimulate the genius of their peoples in art and letters; necessity for sympathetic
encouragement of the two languages and of the mental efforts of each
other; less provincialism or narrowness of mental vision likely to gain larger
audiences in other countries; conditions of higher intellectual development
largely dependent on a widening of our mental horizon, the creation of wider
sympathy for native talent, the disappearance of a tendency to self-depreciation,
and greater self-reliance and confidence in our own intellectual resources.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.</h2>
</div>


<p>I cannot more appropriately commence this address than by
a reference to an oration delivered seven years ago in the great
hall of a famous university which stands beneath the stately
elms of Cambridge, in the old "Bay State" of Massachusetts: a
noble seat of learning in which Canadians take a deep interest,
not only because some of their sons have completed their education
within its walls, but because it represents that culture and
scholarship which know no national lines of separation, but
belong to the world's great Federation of Learning. The orator
was a man who, by his deep philosophy, his poetic genius, his
broad patriotism, his love for England, her great literature and
history, had won for himself a reputation not equalled in some
respects by any other citizen of the United States of these later
times. In the course of a brilliant oration in honour<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of the two
hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of Harvard,
James Russell Lowell took occasion to warn his audience against
the tendency of a prosperous democracy "towards an overweening
confidence in itself and its home-made methods, an overestimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
of material success and a corresponding indifference to the things
of the mind." He did not deny that wealth is a great fertilizer of
civilization and of the arts that beautify it; that wealth is an
excellent thing since it means power, leisure and liberty; "but
these," he went on to say, "divorced from culture, that is, from
intelligent purpose, become the very mockery of their own essence,
not goods, but evils fatal to their possessor, and bring with them,
like the Nibelungen Hoard, a doom instead of a blessing." "I
am saddened," he continued, "when I see our success as a nation
measured by the number of acres under tillage, or of bushels of
wheat exported; for the real value of a country must be weighed
in scales more delicate than the balance of trade. The garners of
Sicily are empty now, but the bees from all climes still fetch
honey from the tiny garden-plot of Theocritus. On a map of the
world you may cover Judea with your thumb, Athens with a
finger-tip, and neither of them figures in the Prices Current; but
they still lord it in the thought and action of every civilized man.
Did not Dante cover with his hood all that was Italy six hundred
years ago? And if we go back a century, where was Germany
outside of Weimar? Material success is good, but only as the
necessary preliminary of better things. The measure of a nation's
true success is the amount it has contributed to the thought, the
moral energy, the intellectual happiness, the spiritual hope and
consolation of mankind."</p>

<p>These eloquently suggestive words, it must be remembered,
were addressed by a great American author to an audience, made
up of eminent scholars and writers, in the principal academic
seat of that New England which has given birth to Emerson,
Longfellow, Bancroft, Prescott, Motley, Hawthorne, Holmes,
Parkman, and many others, representing the brightest thought
and intellect of this continent. These writers were the product
of the intellectual development of the many years that had
passed since the pilgrims landed on the historic rock of Plymouth.
Yet, while Lowell could point to such a brilliant array of historians,
essayists, poets and novelists, as I have just named, as
the latest results of New England culture, he felt compelled to
utter a word of remonstrance against that spirit of materialism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
that was then as now abroad in the land, tending to stifle those
generous intellectual aspirations which are best calculated to
make a people truly happy and great.</p>

<p>Let us now apply these remarks of the eminent American
poet and thinker to Canada&mdash;to ourselves, whose history is even
older than that of New England; contemporaneous rather with
that of Virginia, since Champlain landed on the heights of Quebec
and laid the foundations of the ancient capital only a year
after the English adventurers of the days of King James set their
feet on the banks of the river named after that sovereign and
commenced the old town which has long since disappeared
before the tides of the ocean that stretches away beyond the
shores of the Old Dominion.<a name="FNanchor_2_10" id="FNanchor_2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_10" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If we in Canada are open to the
same charge of attaching too much importance to material things,
are we able at the same time to point to as notable achievements
in literature as results of the three centuries that have nearly
passed since the foundation of New France? I do not suppose
that the most patriotic Canadian, however ready to eulogize his
own country, will make an effort to claim an equality with New
England in this respect; but, if indeed we feel it necessary to
offer any comparison that would do us justice, it would be with
that Virginia whose history is contemporaneous with that of
French Canada. Statesmanship rather than Letters has been the
pride and ambition of the Old Dominion, its brightest and highest
achievement. Virginia has been the mother of great orators and
great presidents, and her men of letters sink into insignificance
alongside of those of New England. It may be said, too, of
Canada, that her history in the days of the French regime, during
the struggle for responsible government, as well as at the birth
of confederation, gives us the names of men of statesmanlike
designs and of patriotic purpose. From the days of Champlain
to the establishment of the confederation, Canada has had the
services of men as eminent in their respective spheres, and as
successful in the attainment of popular rights, in moulding the
educational and political institutions of the country, and in laying
broad and deep the foundations of a new nationality across
half a continent, as those great Virginians to whom the world is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
ever ready to pay its meed of respect. These Virginian statesmen
won their fame in the large theatre of national achievement&mdash;in
laying the basis of the most remarkable federal republic the
world has ever seen; whilst Canadian public men have laboured
with equal earnestness and ability in that far less conspicuous
and brilliant arena of colonial development, the eulogy of which
has to be written in the histories of the future.</p>

<p>Let me now ask you to follow me for a short time whilst I
review some of the most salient features of our intellectual
progress since the days Canada entered on its career of competition
in the civilization of this continent. So far there have
been three well defined eras of development in the country now
known as the Dominion of Canada. First, there was the era of
French Canadian occupation which in many respects had its
heroic and picturesque features. Then, after the cession of Canada
to England, came that era of political and constitutional struggle
for a larger measure of public liberty which ended in the establishment
of responsible government about half a century ago. Then
we come to that era which dates from the confederation of the
provinces&mdash;an era of which the first quarter of a century only has
passed, of which the signs are still full of promise, despite the
prediction of gloomy thinkers, if Canadians remain true to themselves
and face the future with the same courage and confidence
that have distinguished the past.</p>

<p>As I have just said, the days of the French regime were in
a sense days of heroic endeavour, since we see in the vista of the
past a small colony whose total population at no period exceeded
eighty thousand souls, chiefly living on the banks of the St.
Lawrence, between Quebec and Montreal, and contending against
great odds for the supremacy on the continent of America. The
pen of Francis Parkman has given a vivid picture of those days
when bold adventurers unlocked the secrets of this Canadian
Dominion, pushed into the western wilderness, followed unknown
rivers, and at last found a way to the waters of that southern
gulf where Spain had long before, in the days of Grijalva, Cortez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and Pineda, planted her flag and won treasures of gold and silver
from an unhappy people who soon learned to curse the day when
the white men came to the fair islands of the south and the rich
country of Mexico. In these days the world, with universal acclaim
has paid its tribute of admiration to the memory of a great
Discoverer who had the courage of his convictions and led the
way to the unknown lands beyond the Azores and the Canaries.
This present generation has forgiven him much in view of his
heroism in facing the dangers of unknown seas and piercing
their mysteries. His purpose was so great, and his success so
conspicuous, that both have obscured his human weakness. In
some respects he was wiser than the age in which he lived; in
others he was the product of the greed and the superstition of
that age; but we who owe him so much forget the frailty of
the man in the sagacity of the Discoverer. As Canadians, however,
now review the character of the great Genoese, and of his
compeers and successors in the opening up of this continent,
they must, with pride, come to the conclusion that none of these
men can compare in nobility of purpose, in sincere devotion to
God, King and Country, with Champlain, the sailor of Brouage,
who became the founder of Quebec and the father of New
France.</p>

<p>In the daring ventures of Marquette, Jolliet, La Salle and
Tonty, in the stern purpose of Frontenac, in the far-reaching
plans of La Galissoni&#232;re, in the military genius of Montcalm, the
historian of the present time has at his command the most attractive
materials for his pen. But we cannot expect to find the
signs of intellectual development among a people where there
was not a single printing press, where freedom of thought and
action was repressed by a paternal absolutism, where the struggle
for life was very bitter up to the last hours of French
supremacy in a country constantly exposed to the misfortunes of
war, and too often neglected by a king who thought more of his
mistresses than of his harassed and patient subjects across the
sea. Yet that memorable period&mdash;days of struggle in many ways&mdash;was
the origin of a large amount of literature which we, in
these times, find of the deepest interest and value from a historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
point of view. The English colonies of America cannot present
us with any books which, for faithful narrative and simplicity
of style, bear comparison with the admirable works of Champlain,
explorer and historian,<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or with those of the genial and
witty advocate, Marc Lescarbot,<a name="FNanchor_4_12" id="FNanchor_4_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_12" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> names that can never be forgotten
on the picturesque heights of Quebec, or on the banks of
the beautiful basin of Annapolis. Is there a Canadian or American
writer who is not under a deep debt of obligation to the
clear-headed and industrious Jesuit traveller, Charlevoix,<a name="FNanchor_5_13" id="FNanchor_5_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_13" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
Nestor of French Canadian history? The only historical writer
that can at all surpass him in New England was the loyalist
Governor Hutchinson, and he published his books at a later
time when the French dominion had disappeared with the fall
of Quebec.<a name="FNanchor_6_14" id="FNanchor_6_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_14" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> To the works just mentioned we may add the books
of Gabriel Sagard,<a name="FNanchor_7_15" id="FNanchor_7_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_15" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and of Boucher, the governor of Three Rivers
and founder of a still eminent French Canadian family;<a name="FNanchor_8_16" id="FNanchor_8_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_16" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that
remarkable collection of authentic historic narrative, known as
the Jesuit Relations;<a name="FNanchor_9_17" id="FNanchor_9_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_17" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> even that tedious Latin compilation by
P&#232;re du Creux,<a name="FNanchor_10_18" id="FNanchor_10_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_18" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the useful narrative by La Potherie,<a name="FNanchor_11_19" id="FNanchor_11_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_19" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the admirable
account of Indian life and customs by the Jesuit Lafitau,<a name="FNanchor_11A_20" id="FNanchor_11A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_11A_20" class="fnanchor">[11<i>a</i>]</a>
and that now very rare historical account of the French colony,
the "Etablissement de la Foy dans la Nouvelle France," written
by the Recollet le Clercq,<a name="FNanchor_12_21" id="FNanchor_12_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_21" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> probably aided by Frontenac. In
these and other works, despite their diffuseness in some cases,
we have a library of historical literature, which, when supplemented
by the great stores of official documents still preserved
in the French archives, is of priceless value as a true and
minute record of the times in which the authors lived, or which
they described from the materials to which they alone had
access. It may be said with truth that none of these writers
were Canadians in the sense that they were born or educated in
Canada, but still they were the product of the life, the hardships
and the realities of New France&mdash;it was from this country they
drew the inspiration that gave vigour and colour to their
writings. New England, as I have already said, never originated
a class of writers who produced work of equal value, or
indeed of equal literary merit. Religious and polemic controversy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
had the chief attraction for the gloomy, disputatious puritan
native of Massachusetts and the adjoining colonies. Cotton
Mather was essentially a New England creation, and if quantity
were the criterion of literary merit then he was the most distinguished
author of his century; for it is said that indefatigable
antiquarians have counted up the titles of nearly four hundred
books and pamphlets by this industrious writer. His principal
work, however, was the "Magnalia Christi Americana, or Ecclesiastical
History of New England from 1620 to 1698,"<a name="FNanchor_13_22" id="FNanchor_13_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_22" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a large
folio, remarkable as a curious collection of strange conceits, forced
witticisms, and prolixity of narrative, in which the venturesome
reader soon finds himself so irretrievably mystified and lost that
he rises from the perusal with wonderment that so much learning,
as was evidently possessed by the author, could be so used
to bewilder the world of letters. The historical knowledge is
literally choked up with verbiage and mannerisms. Even prosy
du Creux becomes tolerable at times compared with the garrulous
Puritan author.</p>

<p>Though books were rarely seen, and secular education was
extremely defective as a rule throughout the French colony, yet
at a very early period in its history remarkable opportunities
were afforded for the education of a priesthood and the cult of
the principles of the Roman Catholic religion among those
classes who were able to avail themselves of the facilities offered
by the Jesuit College, which was founded at Quebec before even
Harvard at Cambridge, or by the famous Great and Lesser Seminaries
in the same place, in connection with which, in later times,
rose the University with which is directly associated the name
of the most famous Bishop of the French regime. The influence
of such institutions was not simply in making Canada a most
devoted daughter of that great Church, which has ever exercised
a paternal and even absolute care of its people, but also in discouraging
a purely materialistic spirit and probably keeping
alive a taste for letters among a very small class, especially the
priests, who, in politics as in society, have been always a controlling
element in the French province. Evidences of some
culture and intellectual aspirations in the social circles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
ancient capital attracted the surprise of travellers who visited
the country before the close of the French dominion. "Science
and the fine arts," wrote Charlevoix, "have their turn, and conversation
does not fail. The Canadians breathe from their birth
an air of liberty, which makes them very pleasant in the intercourse
of life, and our language is nowhere more purely spoken."
La Galissoni&#232;re, who was an associate member of the French
Academy of Science, and the most highly cultured governor
ever sent out by France, spared no effort to encourage a systematic
study of scientific pursuits in Canada. Dr. Michel Sarrazin,<a name="FNanchor_13A_23" id="FNanchor_13A_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_13A_23" class="fnanchor">[13<i>a</i>]</a>
who was a practising physician in Quebec for nearly half a century,
devoted himself most assiduously to the natural history
of the colony, and made some valuable contributions to the
French Academy, of which he was a correspondent. The
Swedish botanist, Peter Kalm, who visited America in the middle
of the last century, was impressed with the liking for scientific
study which he observed in the French colony. "I have
found," he wrote, "that eminent persons, generally speaking, in
this country, have much more taste for natural history and literature
than in the English colonies, where the majority of people
are entirely engrossed in making their fortune, whilst science is
as a rule held in very light esteem." Strange to say, he ignores
in this passage the scientific labours of Franklin, Bartram and
others he had met in Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_13B_24" id="FNanchor_13B_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_13B_24" class="fnanchor">[13<i>b</i>]</a> As a fact such evidences
of intellectual enlightenment as Kalm and Charlevoix mentioned
were entirely exceptional in the colony, and never showed themselves
beyond the walls of Quebec or Montreal. The province, as
a whole, was in a state of mental sluggishness. The germs of
intellectual life were necessarily dormant among the mass of the
people, for they never could produce any rich fruition until they
were freed from the spirit of absolutism which distinguished
French supremacy, and were able to give full expression to the
natural genius of their race under the inspiration of the liberal
government of England in these later times.</p>

<p>Passing from the heroic days of Canada, which, if it could
hardly in the nature of things originate a native literature, at
least inspired a brilliant succession of historians, essayists and
poets in much later times, we come now to that period of constitutional
and political development which commenced with the
rule of England. It does not fall within the scope of this address
to dwell on the political struggles which showed their intensity
in the rebellion of 1837&ndash;8, and reached their fruition in the concession
of parliamentary government, in the large sense of the
term, some years later. These struggles were carried on during
times when there was only a sparse population chiefly centred
in the few towns of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Upper and
Lower Canada, on the shores of the Atlantic, on the banks of
the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario, and not extending beyond
the peninsula of the present province of Ontario. The cities, or
towns rather, of Halifax, St. John, Quebec, Montreal, Kingston
and York, were then necessarily the only centres of intellectual
life. Education was chiefly under the control of religious bodies
or in the hands of private teachers. In the rural districts it was
at the lowest point possible,<a name="FNanchor_14_25" id="FNanchor_14_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_25" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the great system of free schools
which has of late years extended through the Dominion&mdash;and is
the chief honour of Ontario&mdash;was never dreamed of in those
times of sluggish growth and local apathy, when communication
between the distant parts of the country was slow and wretched,
when the conditions of life were generally very hard and rude,
when the forest still covered the greater portion of the most
fertile districts of Ontario,<a name="FNanchor_15_26" id="FNanchor_15_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_26" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> though here and there the pioneer's
axe could be heard from morn to eve hewing out little patches
of sunlight, so many glimpses of civilization and better times
amid the wildness of a new land even then full of promise.</p>

<p>The newspapers of those days were very few and came only
at uncertain times to the home of the farmer by the side of some
stream or amid the dense forest, or to the little hamlets that
were springing up in favoured spots, and represented so many
radiating influences of intelligence on the borders of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
lakes and their tributary streams, on the Atlantic seaboard, or on
the numerous rivers that form so many natural highways to the
people of the maritime provinces. These newspapers were for
years mostly small quarto or folio sheets, in which the scissors
played necessarily the all-important part; but there was, nevertheless,
before 1840 in the more pretentious journals of the large
towns, some good writing done by thoughtful men who studied
their questions, and helped to atone for the very bitter vindictive
partisan attacks on opponents that too frequently sullied the
press in those times of fierce conflict.<a name="FNanchor_16_27" id="FNanchor_16_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_27" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Books were only found
in the homes of the clergy or of the official classes, and these were
generally old editions and rarely the latest publications of the
time. Montreal and Quebec, for many years, were the only
places where bookstores and libraries of more than a thousand
volumes could be seen. It was not until 1813 that a successful
effort was made to establish a "social library" at Kingston,
Bath, and some other places in the Midland district. Toronto
had no library worth mentioning until 1836. What culture existed
in those rude days was to be hunted up among the clergy,
especially of the Church of England, the Roman Catholic priests
of Lower Canada, and the official classes of the large towns.
Some sermons that have come down to us, in pamphlets of very
common paper&mdash;and very few were printed in those days when
postage was dear and bookselling was not profitable&mdash;have no
pretensions to originality of thought or literary style: sermons
in remarkable contrast with the brilliant and suggestive utterances
of such modern pulpit orators as Professor Clarke, of Trinity.
The exhaustive and, generally, closely reasoned sermons of the
Presbyterian divine had a special flavour of the Westminster confession
and little of the versatility of preachers like Principal
Grant in these later times when men are attempting to make
even dogma more genial, and to understand the meaning of the
sermon in the Mount. Then, as always in Canada, there were
found among the clergy of all denominations hardworking, self-denying
priests and missionaries who brought from time to time
to some remote settlement of the provinces spiritual consolation
and to many a household, long deprived of the intellectual nourishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of other days, an opportunity of conversing on subjects
which in the stern daily routine of their lives in a new country
were seldom or ever talked of. It was in the legislative halls of
the provinces that the brightest intellect naturally found scope for
its display, and at no subsequent period of the political history
of Canada were there more fervid, earnest orators than appeared
in the days when the battle for responsible government was at
its height. The names of Nelson, Papineau, Howe, Baldwin,
Wilmot, Johnstone, Young, Robinson, Rolph and Mackenzie
recall the era when questions of political controversy and political
freedom stimulated mental development among that class
which sought and found the best popular opportunities for the
display of their intellectual gifts in the legislative halls in the
absence of a great printing press and a native literature. Joseph
Howe's speeches<a name="FNanchor_17_28" id="FNanchor_17_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_28" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> displayed a wide culture, an original eloquence,
and a patriotic aspiration beyond those of any other man
of his time and generation, and would have done credit to the
Senate of the United States, then in the zenith of its reputation
as a body of orators and statesmen. It is an interesting fact that
Howe, then printer and publisher, should have printed the first
work of the only great humorist that Canada has yet produced.
I mean of course "The Clockmaker,"<a name="FNanchor_18_29" id="FNanchor_18_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_29" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in which Judge Haliburton
created "Sam Slick," a type of a Down-east Yankee pedlar
who sold his wares by a judicious use of that quality which is
sure to be appreciated the world over, "Soft sawder and human
natur'." In this work, which has run through ever so many
editions, and is still found on the shelves of every well-equipped
library and bookstore, Sam Slick told some home truths to his
somewhat self-satisfied countrymen who could not help laughing
even if the humour touched them very keenly at times.
Nova Scotia has changed much for the better since those dull
times when the house of assembly was expected to be a sort of
political providence, to make all the roads and bridges, and give
good times and harvests; but even now there are some people
cruel enough, after a visit to Halifax, to hint that there still is a
grain of truth in the following reflection on the enterprise of that
beautiful port: "How the folks to Halifax take it all out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
talkin'&mdash;they talk of steam-boats, whalers and railroads&mdash;but
they all end where they begin&mdash;in talk. I don't think I'd be
out in my latitude if I was to say they beat the womankind at
that. One feller says, I talk of goin' to England&mdash;another says,
I talk of goin' to the country&mdash;while another says, I talk of
goin' to sleep. If we Yankees happen to speak of such things
we say, 'I'm right off down East;' or 'I'm away off South,' and
away we go jist like a streak of lightnin'." This clever humourist
also wrote the best history<a name="FNanchor_19_30" id="FNanchor_19_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_30" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;one of his own province&mdash;that
had been written in British North America up to that time&mdash;indeed
it is still most readable, and worthy of a place in every
library. In later days the Judge wrote many other books and
became a member of the English House of Commons: but "Sam
Slick" still remains the most signal illustration of his original
genius.</p>

<p>During this period, however, apart from the two works to
which I have referred, we look in vain for any original literature
worthy of special mention. A history of Canada written by
William Smith,<a name="FNanchor_20_31" id="FNanchor_20_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_31" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> a son of an eminent chief justice of New York,
and subsequently of Canada, was published in excellent style
for those days as early as 1815 at Quebec, but it has no special
value except to the collector of old and rare books. Bouchette's
topographical and geographical account of Canada<a name="FNanchor_21_32" id="FNanchor_21_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_32" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> illustrated
the ability and zeal of an eminent French Canadian, who deserved
the thanks of his country, but these well printed books
were, after all, mere compilations and came from the English
press. Pamphlets were numerous enough, and some of them
had literary skill, but they had, in the majority of cases, no permanent
value except to the historian or antiquarian of the present
day who must sift out all sorts of material and study every
phase and incident of the times he has chosen for his theme.
Michel Bibaud wrote a history of French Canada,<a name="FNanchor_22_33" id="FNanchor_22_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_33" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which no one
reads in these days, and the most of the other works that emanated
from the Canadian press, like Thompson's "War of 1812,"<a name="FNanchor_23_34" id="FNanchor_23_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_34" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
are chiefly valued by the historical collector. It was not to be
expected that in a relatively poor country, still in the infancy of
its development, severely tried by political controversies, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
small population scattered over a long stretch of territory, from
Sydney to Niagara, there could be any intellectual stimulus or
literary effort except what was represented in newspapers like
the <i>Gazette</i> of Montreal&mdash;which has always maintained a certain
dignity of style in its long journalistic career&mdash;the <i>Gazette</i> and
the <i>Canadien</i>, of Quebec, the <i>Nova Scotian</i> of Halifax, or displayed
itself in keen contests in the legislatures or court-houses of a
people delighting always in such displays as there were made of
mental power and natural eloquence. From a literary point of
view our American neighbours had, during this period, left us
away behind, in fact no comparison can be made between the
two countries; laying aside the original creation of Sam Slick.
Towards the close of the eighteenth century Belknap published
his admirable history of New Hampshire,<a name="FNanchor_24_35" id="FNanchor_24_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_35" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> while the third
volume of Hutchinson's history of Massachusetts appeared in
1828, to close a work of rare merit alike for careful research,
philosophic acuteness and literary charm. That admirable collection
of political and constitutional essays known as the "Federalist"
had attained a wide circulation and largely influenced
the destinies of the union under the constitution of 1783. Chief
Justice Marshall illumined the bench by his great judicial decisions
which have won a remarkable place in legal literature, on
account of their close, acute reasoning, breadth of knowledge,
insight into great constitutional principles, and their immediate
influence on the political development of the federal republic.
Washington Irving published, as far back as 1819, his "Sketch
Book," in which appeared the original creation of Rip Van
Winkle, and followed it up with other works which recall Addison's
delightful style, and gave him a fame abroad that no later
American writer has ever surpassed. Cooper's romances began
to appear in 1821, and Bancroft published in 1834 the first volume
of what is a great history despite its somewhat rhetorical and
ambitious style. Hawthorne's "Twice Told Tales" appeared in
1835, but his fame was to be won in later years when he wrote
the "Scarlet Letter" and the "House of Seven Gables," the most
original and quaint productions that New England genius has
yet produced. If I linger for a moment among these men it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
because they were not merely American by the influence of their
writings; but wherever the English tongue is spoken and English
literature is read these writers of a past generation, as it
may be said of others of later times, claim the gratitude of the
untold thousands whom they have instructed and helped in
many a weary and sad, as well as idle hour. They were not
Canadians, but they illustrated the genius of this continent of
ours.</p>

<p>It was in the years that followed the concession of responsible
government that a new era dawned on Canada&mdash;an era of
intellectual as well as material activity. Then common schools
followed the establishment of municipal institutions in Ontario.
Even the province of Quebec awoke from its sullen lethargy and
assumed greater confidence in the future, as its statesmen gradually
recognized the fact that the union of 1841 could be turned
to the advantage of French Canada despite it having been largely
based on the hope of limiting the development of French Canadian
institutions, and gradually leading the way to the assimilation
of the two races. Political life still claimed the best talent
and energy, as it has always done in this country; and, while
Papineau soon disappeared from the arena where he had been,
under a different condition of things, a powerful disturbing influence
among his compatriots, men of greater discretion and wider
statesmanship like Lafontaine, Morin and Cartier, took his place
to the decided benefit of French Canada. Robert Baldwin, a tried
and conservative reformer, yielded to the antagonistic influences
that eventually arrayed themselves in his own party against him
and retired to a privacy from which he never ventured until his
death. William Lyon Mackenzie came back from exile and took
a place once more in legislative halls only to find there was no
longer scope for mere querulous agitators and restless politicians.
Joseph Howe still devoted himself with untiring zeal to his countrymen
in his native province, while Judge Wilmot, afterwards
governor like the former in confederation days, delighted the
people of New Brunswick with his rapid, fervid, scholarly eloquence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
James W. Johnstone, long the leader of the Conservative
party in Nova Scotia, remarkable for his great flow of language
and argument; William Young, an astute politician;
James Boyle Uniacke, with all the genius of an Irish orator;
Laurence O'Connor Doyle, wit and Irishman; Samuel J. W.
Archibald with his silver tongue, afterwards master of the rolls;
Adams G. Archibald, polished gentleman; Leonard Tilley with
his suavity of demeanour and skill as a politician; Charles Tupper
with his great command of language, earnestness of expression
and courage of conviction, were the leading exponents of the
political opinions and of the culture and oratory of Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick. In the upper provinces we had in addition
to the names of the distinguished French Canadians I have
already mentioned, those of John A. Macdonald, at all times a
ready and incisive debater, a great party tactician, and a statesman
of generous aspirations, who was destined to die very many
years later with the knowledge that he had realized his conception
of a federation uniting all the territory of British North
America, from Sydney to Victoria, under one government. The
names of Allan McNab, Francis Hincks, George Brown, George
Etienne Cartier, Alexander Galt, D'Arcy McGee, Louis Sicotte,
John Hillyard Cameron, Alexander Mackenzie, Seth Huntington,
William McDougall, Antoine Dorion, Alexander Campbell, and of
other men, eminent for their knowledge of finance, their powers
as debaters, their graceful oratory, their legal acumen, their political
skill and their intellectual achievements in their respective
spheres, will be recalled by many of those who hear me, since
the most eminent among them have but recently disappeared
from the stage of active life.</p>

<p>As long as party government lasts in this country men will
be divided into political divisions, and objection will be of course
time and again taken to the methods by which these and other
political leaders have achieved their party ends, and none of us
will be always satisfied with the conclusions to which their at
times overweening ambition has led them; but, taking them all
in all, I believe for one who has lived all my life among politicians
and statesmen that, despite their failings and weaknesses, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
public men of our country in those days laboured on the whole
conscientiously from their own points of view to make Canada
happier and greater. Indeed, when I look around me and see
what has been done in the face of great obstacles during a half
century and less, I am bound to pay this tribute to those who
laboured earnestly in the difficult and trying intellectual field of
public life.</p>

<p>But this period which brought so many bright intellects into
the activities of political life was distinguished also, not merely for
the material advance in industry, but notably for some performance
in the less hazardous walk of literature. The newspaper
press with the progress of population, the increase of wealth,
the diffusion of education, the construction of railways and telegraph
lines, and the development of political liberty, found itself
stimulated to new energy and enterprise. A daily press now
commenced to meet the necessities of the larger and wealthier
cities and towns. It must be admitted, however, that from a
strictly intellectual point of view there was not in some respects
a marked advance in the tone and style of the leading public
journals. Political partisanship ran extremely high in those
days&mdash;higher than it has ever since&mdash;and grosser personalities
than have ever characterized newspapers in this country sullied
the editorial columns of leading exponents of public opinion. No
doubt there was much brilliant and forcible writing, despite the
acrimony and abuse that were too often considered more necessary
than incisive argument and logical reasoning when a political
opponent had to be met. It was rarely that one could get
at the whole truth of a question by reading only one newspaper;
it was necessary to take two or three or more on different sides
of politics in order to obtain even an accurate idea of the debates
in the legislative halls. A Liberal or Conservative journal would
consider it beneath its legitimate functions even as a newspaper
to report with any fulness the speeches of its political adversaries.
Of course this is not newspaper editing in the proper sense
of the phrase. It is not the English method assuredly, since the
London <i>Times</i>, the best example of a well-equipped and well-conducted
newspaper, has always considered it necessary to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
equal prominence to the speeches of Peel, Russell, Palmerston,
Derby, Disraeli, Gladstone&mdash;of all the leaders irrespective of
party. Even in these days of heated controversy on the Irish
question one can always find in the columns of the London press
fair and accurate reports of the speeches of Gladstone, Balfour,
McCarthy, Chamberlain, Morley and Blake. This is the sound
basis on which true and honest journalism must always rest if it
is to find its legitimate reward, not in the fickle smiles of the
mere party follower, but in the support of that great public which
can best repay the enterprise and honesty of a true newspaper.
Still, despite this violent partisanship to which bright intellects
lowered themselves, and the absence of that responsibility to
public opinion expected from its active teachers, the press of
Canada, during the days of which I am speaking, kept pace
in some essential respects with the material progress of the
country, and represented too well the tone and spirit of the mass
in the country where the rudiments of culture were still rough
and raw. Public intelligence, however, was being gradually
diffused, and according as the population increased, and the
material conditions of the country improved, a literature of some
merit commenced to show itself. The poems of Cr&#233;mazie,<a name="FNanchor_25_36" id="FNanchor_25_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_36" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of
Chauveau,<a name="FNanchor_26_37" id="FNanchor_26_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_37" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of Howe,<a name="FNanchor_27_38" id="FNanchor_27_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_38" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of Sangster<a name="FNanchor_28_39" id="FNanchor_28_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_39" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and others, were imbued
with a truly Canadian spirit&mdash;with a love for Canada, its scenery,
its history and its traditions, which entitled them to a larger
audience than they probably ever had in this or other countries.
None of those were great poets, but all of them were more or less
gifted with a measure of true poetic genius, the more noteworthy
because it showed itself in the rawness and newness of a colonial
life. Amid the activities of a very busy period the poetic instinct
of Canadians constantly found some expression. One almost
now forgotten poet who was engaged in journalism in Montreal
wrote an ambitious drama, "Saul," which was described at the
time by a British critic as "a drama treated with great poetic
power and depth of psychological knowledge which are often
quite startling;" and the author followed it up with other poems,
displaying also much imagination and feeling, but at no time
reaching the ears of a large and appreciative audience. We cannot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
however, claim Charles Heavysege<a name="FNanchor_29_40" id="FNanchor_29_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_40" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> as a product of Canadian
soil and education, for he was a man of mature age when he
made his home in this country, and his works were in no wise
inspired by Canadian sentiment, scenery or aspiration. In history
Canadians have always shown some strength, and perhaps
this was to be expected in view of the fact that political and historical
literature&mdash;such works as Hamilton's "Federalist" or
Todd's "Parliamentary Government"<a name="FNanchor_30_41" id="FNanchor_30_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_41" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>&mdash;naturally engages the
attention of active intellects in a new country at a time when
its institutions have to be moulded, and it is necessary to collect
precedents and principles from the storehouse of the past for the
assistance of the present. A most useful narrative of the political
occurrences in Lower Canada, from the establishment of legislative
institutions until the rebellion of 1837&ndash;38 and the union
of 1841, was written by Mr. Robert Christie, long a publicist of
note and a member of the assembly of the province. While it
has no claim to literary style it has the great merit of stating the
events of the day with fairness and of citing at length numerous
original documents bearing on the text.<a name="FNanchor_31_42" id="FNanchor_31_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_42" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In French Canada the
names of Garneau<a name="FNanchor_32_43" id="FNanchor_32_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_43" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and Ferland<a name="FNanchor_33_44" id="FNanchor_33_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_44" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> have undoubtedly received
their full meed of praise for their clearness of style, industry of
research, and scholarly management of their subject. Now that
the political passion that so long convulsed the public mind in
this country has disappeared with the causes that gave it birth,
one is hardly prepared to make as much a hero of Papineau as
Garneau attempted in his assuredly great book, while the foundation
of a new Dominion and the dawn of an era of larger political
life, has probably given a somewhat sectional character to
such historical work. Still, despite its intense French Canadian
spirit, Garneau's volumes notably illustrate the literary instinct
and intellectual strength which have always been distinguishing
features of the best productions of the able and even brilliant
men who have devoted themselves to literature with marked
success among their French Canadian countrymen, who are wont
to pay a far deeper homage to such literary efforts than the colder,
less impulsive English Canadian character has ever shown itself
disposed to give to those who have been equally worthy of recognition
in the English-speaking provinces.</p>

<p>As I glance over my library shelves I find indeed that historical
literature has continued since the days of Garneau and
Ferland, to enlist the earnest and industrious study of Canadians
with more or less success. In English Canada, John Charles
Dent produced a work on the political development of Canada
from the union of 1841 until the confederation of 1867, which
was written with fairness and ability, but he was an Englishman
by birth and education, though resident for many years in
the city of Toronto.<a name="FNanchor_34_45" id="FNanchor_34_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_45" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And here let me observe that though such
men as Dent, Heavysege, Faillon, Daniel Wilson, Hunt, D'Arcy
McGee and Goldwin Smith were not born or educated in Canada
like Haliburton, Logan, J. W. Dawson, Joseph Howe, Wilmot,
Cartier, Garneau, or Fr&#233;chette, but only came to this country in
the maturity of their mental powers, yet to men of their class
the Dominion owes a heavy debt of gratitude for the ability and
earnestness with which they have elevated the intellectual standard
of the community where they have laboured. Although all
of us may not be prepared to accept the conclusions of the historian,
or approve the judgment of the political critic; although
we may regret that a man of such deep scholarship and wide
culture as Goldwin Smith has never yet been able to appreciate
the Canadian or growing national sentiment of this dependency,
yet who can doubt, laying aside all political or personal prejudice,
that he, like the others I have named, has stimulated intellectual
development in his adopted home, and so far has given
us compensation for some utterances which, so many Canadians
honestly believe, mar an otherwise useful and brilliant career.
Such literary men have undoubtedly their uses, since they seem
specially intended by a wise dispensation of affairs to cure us
of too much self-complacency, and to prevent us from falling
into a condition of mental stagnation by giving us from time to
time abundant material for reflection. So much, by way of
parenthesis, is due to the able men who have adopted Canada
as their home and have been labouring in various vocations to
stimulate the intellectual growth of this Dominion. A most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
accurate historical record of the same period of our history as
that reviewed by Dent was made in French about the same
time by Louis Turcotte of Quebec.<a name="FNanchor_35_46" id="FNanchor_35_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_46" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Mr. Benjamin Sulte, a member
of this society, has also given us the results of many years of
conscientious research in his "Histoire des Canadiens," which
is not so well known as it ought to be, probably on account of
its cumbrous size and mode of publication.<a name="FNanchor_36_47" id="FNanchor_36_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_47" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The Abb&#233; Casgrain,
also a member of the society and a most industrious author, has
recently devoted himself with true French Canadian fervour to
the days of Montcalm and L&#233;vis, and by the aid of a large mass
of original documents has thrown much light on a very interesting
and important epoch of the history of America.<a name="FNanchor_37_48" id="FNanchor_37_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_48" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Dr. Kingsford
with patience and industry has continued his history of
Canada, which is distinguished by accuracy and research.<a name="FNanchor_38_49" id="FNanchor_38_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_49" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It
is not my intention to enumerate all those names which merit
remark in this connection, for this is not a collection of bibliographical
notes,<a name="FNanchor_39_50" id="FNanchor_39_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_50" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> but simply a review of the more salient features
of our intellectual development in the well-marked periods of our
history. Indeed it is gratifying to us to know that the Royal
Society comprises within its ranks nearly all the historical writers
in Canada, and it would seem too much like pure egotism were I
to dilate on their respective performances. Of poets since the
days of Cr&#233;mazie we have had our full proportion, and it is
encouraging to know that the poems of Fr&#233;chette,&mdash;whose best
work has been crowned by the French Academy,&mdash;LeMay, Reade,
Mair, Roberts, Bliss Carman, Wilfred Campbell and Lampman
have gained recognition from time to time in the world of letters
outside of Canada.<a name="FNanchor_40_51" id="FNanchor_40_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_51" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> We have yet to produce in English Canada
a book of poems which can touch the sympathies and live on the
lips of the world like those of Whittier and Longfellow, but we
need not despair since even in the country which gave these
birth they have not their compeers. Some even declare that the
only bard of promise who appears in these days to touch that
chord of nature which makes the whole world kin is James
Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier poet, despite his tendency to exaggerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
provincial dialect and make his true poetic genius too
subordinate to what becomes at last an affectation and a mere
mannerism which wearies by its very repetition. Even in England
there is hesitation in choosing a poet laureate; there are
Swinburne, Morris and other poets, but not another Tennyson,
and it has been even suggested that the honour might pass to a
master of poetic prose, John Ruskin, whose brilliant genius has
been ever devoted to a lofty idealism which would make the
world much happier and better. At the present time Canadian
poets obtain a place with regularity in the best class of American
magazines, and not infrequently their verse reaches a higher level
than the majority of poetic aspirants who appear in the same
field of poetry; but for one I am not an ardent admirer of American
magazine poems which appear too often mere machine work
and not the results of that true poetic inspiration which alone
can achieve permanent fame.</p>

<p>The poems of the well known American authors, Aldrich,
Gilder and Stedman, have certainly an easy rhythmical flow and
an artistic finish which the majority of Canadian poetic aspirants
should study with far more closeness. At the same time it may
be said that even these artists do not often surpass in poetic
thought the best productions of the Canadians to whom I have
referred as probably illustrating most perfectly the highest development
so far among us of this department of <i>belles-lettres</i>. It is
not often that one comes across more exquisitely conceived poems
than some of those written by Mr. John Reade, whom the laborious
occupation of journalism and probably the past indifference
of a Canadian public to Canadian poetry have for a long while
diverted from a literary field where it would seem he should
have won a wider fame. Among the verses which one can read
time and again are those of which the first lines are</p>

<p>It would be interesting as well as instructive if some competent
critic, with the analytical faculty and the poetic instinct
of Matthew Arnold or Sainte-Beuve, were to study the English
and French Canadian poets and show whether they are mere
imitators of the best models of French and English literature,
or whether their work contains within itself those germs which
give promise of original fruition in the future. It will be remembered
that the French critic, though a poet of merit himself, has
spoken of what he calls "the radical inadequacy of French
poetry." In his opinion, whatever talent the French poets have
for strophe and line, their work, as a rule is "too slight, too soon
read, too poor in ideas, to influence a serious mind for any length
of time." No doubt many others think that, in comparison with
the best conceptions of Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Emerson,
Browning and Tennyson, French poetry is, generally speaking,
inadequate for the expression of the most sublime thoughts, of
the strongest passion, or of the most powerful imagination, and
though it must always please us by its easy rhythm and lucidity
of style, it fails to make that vivid impression on the mind and
senses which is the best test of that true poetic genius which
influences generations and ever lives in the hearts of the people.
It represents in some respects the lightness and vivacity of the
French intellectual temperament under ordinary conditions, and
not the strength of the national character, whose depths are only
revealed at some crisis which evokes a deep sentiment of patriotism.
"Partant pour la Syrie," so often heard in the days of the
last Bonaparte regime, probably illustrated this lighter tendency
of the French mind just as the "Marseillaise," the noblest and
most impressive of popular poetic outbursts, illustrated national
passion evoked by abnormal conditions. French Canadian poetry
has been often purely imitative of French models, like Musset
and Gauthier, both in style and sentiment, and consequently
lacked strength and originality. It might be thought that in
this new country poets would be inspired by original conceptions&mdash;that
the intellectual fruition would be fresh and vigorous like
some natural products that grow so luxuriantly on the virginal
soil of the new Dominion, and not like those which grow on land
which is renewed and enriched by artificial means after centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
of growth. Perhaps the literature of a colonial dependency,
or a relatively new country, must necessarily in its first stages
be imitative, and it is only now and then an original mind bursts
the fetters of intellectual subordination. In the United States
Emerson and Hawthorne probably best represent the original
thought and imagination of that comparatively new country,
just as Aldrich and Howells represent in the first case English
culture in poetry, and in the other the sublimated essence of
reportorial realism. The two former are original thinkers, the
two others pure imitators. Walt Whitman's poems certainly
show at times much power and originality of conception, but
after all they are simply the creations of an eccentric genius
and illustrate a phase of that Realism towards which fiction
even in America has been tending of late, and which has been
already degraded in France to a Naturalism which is positively
offensive. He has not influenced to any perceptible extent the
intellect of his generation or elevated the thoughts of his countrymen
like the two great minds I have just named. Yet even
Whitman's success, relatively small as it was in his own country,
arose chiefly from the fact that he attempted to be an <i>American</i>
poet, representing the pristine vigour and natural freedom
of a new land. It is when French Canadian poets become thoroughly
Canadian by the very force of the inspiration of some
Canadian subject they have chosen, that we can see them at their
best. Fr&#233;chette has all the finish of the French poets, and while
it cannot be said that he has yet originated great thoughts which
are likely to live among even the people whom he has so often
instructed and delighted, yet he has given us poems like that on
the discovery of the Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> which proves that he is capable
of even better things if he would always seek inspiration
from the sources of the deeply interesting history of his own country,
or enter into the inner mysteries and social relations of his
own people, rather than dwell on the lighter shades and incidents
of their lives. Perhaps in some respects Cr&#233;mazie had
greater capabilities for the poems of deep passion or vivid imagination
than any of his successors in literature; the few national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
poems he left behind are a promise of what he could have produced
had the circumstances of his later life been happier.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
After all, the poetry that lives is the poetry of human life and
human sympathy, of joy and sorrow, rather than verses on mountains,
rivers and lakes, or sweetly worded sonnets to Madame B.
or Mademoiselle C. When we compare the English with the
French Canadian poets we can see what an influence the more
picturesque and interesting history of French Canada exercises
on the imagination of its writers. The poets that claim Ontario
for their home give us rhythmical and pleasing descriptions of
the lake and river scenery of which the varied aspects and moods
might well captivate the eye of the poet as well as of the painter.
It is very much painting in both cases; the poet should be an
artist by temperament equally with the painter who puts his
thoughts on canvas and not in words. Descriptions of our meadows,
prairies and forests, with their wealth of herbage and
foliage, or artistic sketches of pretty bits of lake scenery have
their limitations as respects their influence on a people. Great
thoughts or deeds are not bred by scenery. The American poem
that has captured the world is not any one of Bryant's delightful
sketches of the varied landscape of his native land, but Longfellow's
Evangeline, which is a story of the "affection that
hopes, and endures and is patient." Dollard, and the Lady of
Fort La Tour are themes which we do not find in prosaic Ontario,
whose history is only a century old&mdash;a history of stern
materialism as a rule, rarely picturesque or romantic, and hardly
ever heroic except in some episodes of the war of 1812&ndash;15, in
which Canadians, women as well as men, did their duty faithfully
to king and country, though their deeds have never yet been
adequately told in poem or prose. The story of Laura Secord's
toilsome journey on a June day eighty years ago<a name="FNanchor_41A_53" id="FNanchor_41A_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_41A_53" class="fnanchor">[41<i>a</i>]</a> seems as susceptible
of strong poetic treatment as Paul Revere's Ride, told
in matchless verse by Longfellow.</p>

<p>I think if we compare the best Canadian poems with the
same class of literature in Australia the former do not at all lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
by the comparison. Thanks to the thoughtfulness of a friend in
South Australia I have had many opportunities of late of studying
the best work of Australian writers, chiefly poets and novelists,<a name="FNanchor_42_54" id="FNanchor_42_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_54" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and have come to the conclusion that at least the poets of
both hemispheres&mdash;for to fiction we cannot make even a pretense&mdash;reflect
credit on each country. In one respect indeed Canadians
can claim a superiority over their fellow-citizens of the
British Empire in that far off Australian land, and that is, in the
fact that we have poets, and historians, and essayists, who write
the languages of France and England with purity and even elegance;
that the grace and precision of the French tongue have
their place in this country alongside the vigorous and copious
expression of the English language. More than that, the Canadians
have behind them a history which is well calculated to
stimulate writers to give utterance to national sentiment. I
mean national in the sense of being thoroughly imbued with a
love for the country, its scenery, its history and its aspirations.
The people of that great island continent possess great natural
beauties and riches&mdash;flowers and fruits of every kind flourish
there in rare profusion, and gold and gems are among the treasures
of the soil, but its scenery is far less varied and picturesque
than ours and its history is but of yesterday compared with that
of Canada. Australians cannot point to such historic ground as
is found from Louisbourg to Quebec, or from Montreal to Champlain,
the battle ground of nations whose descendants now live
under one flag, animated by feelings of a common interest and a
common aspiration for the future!</p>

<p>Perhaps if I were at any time inclined to be depressed as to
the future of Canada, I should find some relief in those poems by
Canadian authors which take frequently an elevated and patriotic
range of thought and vision, and give expression to aspirations
worthy of men born and living in this country. When
some men doubt the future and would see us march into the
ranks of other states, with heads bowed down in confession of our
failure to hold our own on this continent and build up a new
nation always in the closest connection with England, I ask them
to turn to the poems of Joseph Howe and read that inspiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
poetic tribute to the mother country, "All hail to the day when
the Britons came over"&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

  <div class="i0">"Every flash of her genius our pathway enlightens,</div>
  <div class="i2">Every field she explores we are beckoned to tread,</div>

  <div class="i2">We joy with her living and mourn with her dead."<a name="FNanchor_43_55" id="FNanchor_43_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_55" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or read that tribute which the French Canadian laureate,
Fr&#233;chette, has been fain to pay to the English flag under whose
folds his country has enjoyed so much freedom and protection for
its institutions:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">

  <div class="i0">Il flotte glorieusement."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or take up a volume by Roberts and read that frequently
quoted poem of which these are the closing lines:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Shall not our love this rough sweet land make sure?</div>
  <div class="i2">Her bounds preserve inviolate, though we die.</div>
  <div class="i8">O strong hearts of the North,</div>
  <div class="i8">Let flame your loyalty forth,</div>
  <div class="i0">And put the craven and base to an open shame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till earth shall know the Child of Nations by her name."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even Mr. Edgar has forgotten the astute lawyer and the
politician in his national song, "This Canada of Ours," and has
given expression to the deep sentiment that lies as I have said
in the heart of every true Canadian and forces him at times to
words like these:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Strong arms shall guard our cherished homes</div>
  <div class="i6">When darkest danger lowers,</div>

  <div class="i8">This Canada of ours,</div>

<p>Such poems are worth a good many political speeches even
in parliament so far as their effect upon the hearts and sympathies
is concerned. We all remember a famous man once said,
"Let me make all the ballads, and I care not who makes the
laws of a people."</p>

<p>But if Canada can point to some creditable achievement of
recent years in history, poetry and essay-writing&mdash;for I think if
one looks from time to time at the leading magazines and reviews
of the two continents he will find that Canada is fairly well
represented in their pages<a name="FNanchor_44_56" id="FNanchor_44_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_56" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;there is one respect in which Canadians
have never won any marked success, and that is in the novel
or romance. "Wacousta, or the Prophecy: a Tale of the Canadas,"
was written sixty years ago by Major John Richardson,<a name="FNanchor_45A_58" id="FNanchor_45A_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_45A_58" class="fnanchor">[45<i>a</i>]</a>
a native Canadian, but it was at the best a spirited imitation
of Cooper, and has not retained the interest it attracted at a time
when the American novelist had created a taste for exaggerated
pictures of Indian life and forest scenery. Of course attempts
have been made time and again by other English Canadians to
describe episodes of our history, and portray some of our national
and social characteristics, but with the single exception of "The
Golden Dog,"<a name="FNanchor_45_57" id="FNanchor_45_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_57" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> written a few years ago by Mr. William Kirby,
of Niagara, I cannot point to one which shows much imaginative
or literary skill. If we except the historical romance by Mr. Marmette,
"Fran&#231;ois de Bienville,"<a name="FNanchor_46_59" id="FNanchor_46_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_59" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which has had several editions,
French Canada is even weak in this particular, and this is the
more surprising because there is abundance of material for the
novelist or writer of romance in her peculiar society and institutions,
and in her historic annals and traditions. But as yet neither
a Cooper, nor an Irving, nor a Hawthorne has appeared to delight
Canadians in the fruitful field of fiction that their country offers
to the pen of imaginative genius. It is true we have a work by
De Gasp&#233;, "Les Anciens Canadiens,"<a name="FNanchor_47_60" id="FNanchor_47_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_60" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> which has been translated
by Roberts and one or two others, but it has rather the value of
historical annals than the spirit and form of true romance. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
is the very poverty of our production in what ought to be a rich
source of literary inspiration, French Canadian life and history,
that has given currency to a work whose signal merit is its simplicity
of style and adherence to historical fact. As Parkman
many years ago first commenced to illumine the too often dull
pages of Canadian history, so other American writers have also
ventured in the still fresh field of literary effort that romance
offers to the industrious, inventive brain. In the "Romance of
Dollard," "Tonty," and the "Lady of Fort St. John," Mrs. Mary
Hartwell Catherwood has recalled most interesting episodes of
our past annals with admirable literary taste and a deep enthusiasm
for Canadian history in its romantic and picturesque aspects.<a name="FNanchor_48_61" id="FNanchor_48_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_61" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
When we read Conan Doyle's "Refugees"&mdash;the best
historical novel that has appeared from the English Press for
years&mdash;we may well regret that it is not Canadian genius which
has created so fascinating a romance out of the materials that
exist in the history of the <i>ancien r&#233;gime</i>. Dr. Doyle's knowledge
of Canadian life and history is obviously very superficial; but
slight as it is he has used it with a masterly skill to give Canada
a part in his story&mdash;to show how closely associated were the fortunes
of the colony with the French Court,&mdash;with the plans and
intrigues of the king and his mistresses, and of the wily ecclesiastics
who made all subservient to their deep purpose. It would
seem from our failure to cultivate successfully the same popular
branch of letters that Canadians are wanting in the inventive and
imaginative faculty, and that the spirit of materialism and practical
habits, which has so long necessarily cramped literary effort in
this country, still prevents happy ventures in this direction. It is
a pity that no success has been won in this country,&mdash;as in Australia
by Mrs. Campbell Praed, "Tasma," and many others,&mdash;in the
way of depicting those characteristics of Canadian life, in the
past and present, which, when touched by the imaginative and
cultured intellect, will reach the sympathies and earn the plaudits
of all classes of readers at home and abroad. Perhaps, Mr.
Gilbert Parker,<a name="FNanchor_49_62" id="FNanchor_49_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_62" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> now a resident of London, but a Canadian by
birth, education and sympathies, will yet succeed in his laudable
ambition of giving form and vitality to the abundant materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
that exist in the Dominion, among the habitants on the old seigneuries
of the French province, in that historic past of which the
ruins still remain in Montreal and Quebec, in the Northwest with
its quarrels of adventurers in the fur trade, and in the many other
sources of inspiration that exist in this country for the true story-teller
who can invent a plot and give his creations a touch of
reality, and not that doll-like, saw-dust appearance that the vapid
characters of some Canadian stories assume from the very poverty
of the imagination that has originated them.</p>

<p>That imagination and humour have some existence in the
Canadian mind&mdash;though one sees little of those qualities in the
press or in public speeches, or in parliamentary debates&mdash;we can
well believe when we read "The Dodge Club Abroad," by Professor
De Mille,<a name="FNanchor_50_63" id="FNanchor_50_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_63" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who was cut off in the prime of his intellectual
strength, or "A Social Departure," by Sara Jeannette Duncan,<a name="FNanchor_51_64" id="FNanchor_51_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_64" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
who, as a sequence of a trip around the world, has given us not
a dry book of travels but a story with touches of genial humour
and bright descriptions of life and nature, and who is now following
up that excellent literary effort by promising sketches of East
Indian life. A story which attracted some attention not long
since for originality of conception and ran through several editions,
"Beggars All," is written by a Miss L. Dougall, who is said
to be a member of a Montreal family, and though this book does
not deal with incidents of Canadian life it illustrates that fertility
of invention which is latent among our people and only requires
a favourable opportunity to develop itself. The best literature
of this kind is like that of France, which has the most intimate
correspondence with the social life and development of the people
of the country. "The excellence of a romance," writes Chevalier
Bunsen in his critical preface to Gustav Freytag's "Debit and
Credit," "like that of an epic or a drama, lies in the apprehension
and truthful exhibition of the course of human things....
The most vehement longing of our times is manifestly after a
faithful mirror of the present." With us, all efforts in this
direction have been most common place&mdash;hardly above the
average of "Social Notes" in the columns of Ottawa newspapers.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>I do not for one depreciate the influence of good fiction on
the minds of a reading community like ours; it is inevitable that
a busy people, and especially women distracted with household
cares, should always find that relief in this branch of literature
which no other reading can give them; and if the novel has
then become a necessity of the times in which we live, at all
events I hope Canadians, who may soon venture into the field,
will study the better models, endeavour to infuse some originality
into their creations and plots, and not bring the Canadian fiction
of the future to that low level to which the school of realism in
France, and in a minor degree in England and the United States,
would degrade the novel and story of every-day life. To my
mind it goes without saying that a history written with that
fidelity to original authorities, that picturesqueness of narration,
that philosophic insight into the motives and plans of statesmen,
that study and comprehension of the character and life of a
people, which should constitute the features of a great work of
this class,&mdash;that such a history has assuredly a much deeper and
more useful purpose in the culture and education of the world
than any work of fiction can possibly have even when animated
by a lofty genius. Still as the novel and romance will be written
as long as a large proportion of the world amid the cares and
activities of life seeks amusement rather than knowledge, it is
for the Canadian Scott, or Hawthorne, or "George Eliot," or
Dickens of the future, to have a higher and purer aim than the
majority of novel writers of the present day, who, with a few
notable exceptions like Black, Besant, Barrie, Stephenson or Oliphant,
weary us by their dulness and lack of the imaginative
and inventive faculty, and represent rather the demands of the
publishers to meet the requirements of a public which must
have its new novel as regularly as the Scotchman must have his
porridge, the Englishman his egg and toast, and the American
his ice-water.</p>

<p>If it were possible within the compass of this address to give
a list of the many histories, poems, essays and pamphlets that
have appeared from the Canadian press during the first quarter of
a century since the Dominion of Canada has been in existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the number would astonish many persons who have not followed
our literary activity. Of course the greater part of this work is
ephemeral in its character and has no special value; much of the
historical work is a dreary collection of facts and dates which
shows the enterprise of school publishers and school teachers and
is generally wanting in that picturesqueness and breadth of view
which give interest to history and leave a vivid impression on
the mind of the student. Most of these pamphlets have been
written on religious, political or legal questions of the day.
Many of the poems illustrate rather the aspirations of the school
boy or maiden whose effusions generally appeared in the poet's
corner of the village newspaper. Still there are even among these
mere literary "transients" evidences of power of incisive argument
and of some literary style. In fact, all the scientific, historical
and poetical contributions of the period in question, make
up quite a library of Canadian literature. And here let me observe
in passing, some persons still suppose that <i>belles-lettres</i>, works
of fiction, poetry and criticism, alone constitute literature. The
word can take in its complete sense a very wide range, for it embraces
the pamphlet or monograph on the most abstruse scientific,
or mathematical or geographical or physical subject, as well as
the political essay, the brilliant history, or the purely imaginative
poem or novel. It is not so much the subject as the form and
style which make them worthy of a place in literature. One of
the most remarkable books ever written, the "Esprit des Lois"
by Montesquieu, has won the highest place in literature by its
admirable style, and in the science of politics by the importance
of its matter. The works of Lyell, Huxley, Hunt, Dawson, Tyndall,
and Darwin owe their great value not entirely to the scientific
ideas and principles and problems there discussed, but also
to the lucidity of style in which the whole subject is presented
to the reader, whether versed or not in science. "Literature is
a large word," says Matthew Arnold,<a name="FNanchor_52_65" id="FNanchor_52_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_65" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> discussing with Tyndall
this very subject; "it may mean everything written with letters
or printed in a book. Euclid's Elements and Newton's Principia
are thus literature. All knowledge that reaches us through
books is literature. But as I do not mean, by knowing ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Rome, knowing merely more or less of Latin <i>belles-lettres</i>, and
taking no account of Rome's military, and political, and legal,
and administrative work in the world; and as, by knowing
ancient Greece, I understand knowing her as the giver of Greek
art, and the guide to a free and right use of reason and to scientific
methods, and the founder of our mathematics, and physics,
and astronomy, and biology, I understand knowing her as all
this, and not merely knowing certain Greek poems, and histories,
and treatises and speeches, so as to the knowledge of modern
nations also. By knowing modern nations, I mean not merely
knowing their <i>belles-lettres</i>, but knowing also what has been done
by such men as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin." I submit
this definition of literature by a great English critic and
poet who certainly knew what he was writing about, to the studious
consideration of Principal Grant who, in an address to the
Royal Society two years ago,<a name="FNanchor_53_66" id="FNanchor_53_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_66" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> appeared to have some doubt that
much of its work could be called literature; a doubt that he
forgot for the moment actually consigned to a questionable level
also his many devious utterances and addresses on political, religious
and other questions of the day, and left him entirely out
of the ranks of <i>litt&#233;rateurs</i> and in a sort of limbo which is a world
of neither divinity, nor politics, nor letters. Taking this definition
of the bright apostle of English culture, I think Canadians
can fairly claim to have some position as a literary people even
if it be a relatively humble one, on account of the work done in
history, <i>belles-lettres</i>, political science and the sciences generally
Science alone has had in Canada for nearly half a century many
votaries who have won for themselves high distinction, as the
eminent names on the list of membership of the Royal Society
since its foundation can conclusively show. The literature of
science, as studied and written by Canadians, is remarkably comprehensive,
and finds a place in every well furnished library of
the world.</p>

<p>The <i>doyen</i> of science in Canada, Sir William Dawson,<a name="FNanchor_54_67" id="FNanchor_54_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_67" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> we
are all glad to know, is still at work after a long and severe illness,
which was, no doubt, largely due to the arduous devotion
of years to education and science. It is not my intention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
refer here to other well-known names in scientific literature, but
I may pause for an instant to mention the fact that one of the
earliest scientific writers of eminence, who was a Canadian by
birth and education, was Mr. Elkanah Billings,<a name="FNanchor_55_68" id="FNanchor_55_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_68" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> pal&#230;ontologist
and geologist, who contributed his first papers to the <i>Citizen</i> of
Ottawa, then Bytown, afterwards to have greatness thrown upon
it and made the political capital of Canada.</p>

<p>Here I come naturally to answer the questions that may be
put by some that have not followed the history and the work of
the Royal Society of Canada,&mdash;What measure of success has it
won? has it been of value to the Canadian people in whose interests
it was established, and with whose money it is mainly
supported? Twelve years have nearly passed away since a few
gentlemen, engaged in literary, scientific and educational pursuits,
assembled at McGill College on the invitation of the Marquess
of Lorne, then governor-general of Canada, to consider the
practicability of establishing a society which would bring together
both the French and English Canadian elements of our population
for purposes of common study and the discussion of such
subjects as might be profitable to the Dominion, and at the same
time develop the literature of learning and science as far as practicable.<a name="FNanchor_56_69" id="FNanchor_56_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_69" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
This society was to have a Dominion character&mdash;to
form a union of leading representatives of all those engaged in
literature and science in the several provinces, with the principle
of federation observed in so far as it asked every society of note
in every section to send delegates to make reports on the work of
the year within its particular sphere. Of the gentlemen who
assembled at this interesting meeting beneath the roof of the
learned principal of Montreal's well-known university, the majority
still continue active friends of the society they aided Lord
Lome to found; but I must also add with deep regret that, within
a little more than a year, two of the most distinguished promoters
of the society, Dr. Thomas Sterry Hunt and Sir Daniel
Wilson, have been called from their active and successful labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
in education, science and letters. As I know perhaps better than
any one else, on account of an official connection with the society
from the very hour it was suggested by Lord Lorne, no two members
ever comprehended more thoroughly the useful purpose
which it could serve amid the all-surrounding materialism of this
country, or laboured more conscientiously until the very hour of
their death by their writings and their influence to make the
society a Canadian institution, broad in its scope, liberal in its
culture, and elevated in its aspirations. Without dwelling on the
qualifications of two men<a name="FNanchor_57_70" id="FNanchor_57_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_70" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> whose names are imperishably connected
with the work of their lifetime&mdash;arch&#230;ology, education
and chemistry&mdash;I may go on to say that the result of the Montreal
meeting was the establishment of a society which met for the first
time at Ottawa in the May of 1882, with a membership of eighty
Fellows under the presidency of Dr. (afterwards Sir) William
Dawson, and the vice-presidency of the Honourable P. J. O. Chauveau,
a distinguished French Canadian who had won a high
name, not only in literature, but also in the political world where
he was for years a conspicuous figure; noted for his eloquence,
his culture and his courtesy of manner. The society was established
in no spirit of isolation from other literary and scientific
men because its membership was confined at the outset to eighty
Fellows who had written "memoirs of merit or rendered eminent
services to literature or science"&mdash;a number subsequently
increased to a hundred under certain limitations. On the contrary
it asks for, and has constantly published, contributions
from all workers in the same fields of effort with the simple proviso
that such contributions are presented with the endorsation
of an actual member, though they may be read before any one of
the four sections by the author himself. Every association, whether
purely literature or historical, or scientific, as I have already
intimated, has been asked to assist in the work of the society,<a name="FNanchor_58_71" id="FNanchor_58_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_71" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
and its delegates given every advantage at the meetings possessed
by the Fellows themselves, except voting and discussing the
purely internal affairs of the Royal Society. Some misapprehension
appears to have existed at first in the public mind that,
because the society was named "The Royal Society of Canada,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
an exclusive and even aristocratic institution was in contemplation.
It seems a little perplexing to understand why an objection
could be taken to such a designation when the Queen is
at the head of our system of government, and her name appears
in the very first clauses of the act of union, and in every act requiring
the exercise of the royal prerogative in this loyal dependency
of the crown. As a fact, in using the title, the desire was
to follow the example of similar societies in Australia, and recall
that famous Royal Society in England, whose fellowship is a title
of nobility in the world of science. Certain features were copied
from the Institute of France, inasmuch as there is a division into
sections with the idea of bringing together into each for the purposes
of common study and discussion those men who have devoted
themselves to special branches of the literature of learning
and science. In this country and, indeed, in America generally,
a notable tendency is what may be called the levelling principle&mdash;to
deprecate the idea that any man should be in any way
better than another; and in order to prevent that result it is
necessary to assail him as soon as he shows any political or intellectual
merit, and to stop him, if possible, from attaining that
mental superiority above his fellows that his industry and his
ability may enable him to reach. The Royal Society suffered a
little at first from this spirit of depreciation which is often carried
to an extent that one at times could almost believe that this is a
country without political virtues or intellectual development of
any kind. The claims of some of its members were disputed by
literary aspirants who did not happen for a moment to be enrolled
in its ranks, and the society was charged with exclusiveness
when, as a fact, it simply limited its membership, and
demanded certain qualifications, with the desire to make that
membership a test of some intellectual effort, and consequently
more prized by those who were allowed sooner or later to enter.
It would have been quite possible for the society to make itself
a sort of literary or scientific picnic by allowing every man or
woman who had, or believed they had, some elementary scientific
or other knowledge to enter its ranks, and have the consequent
advantages of cheap railway fares and other subsidiary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
advantages on certain occasions, but its promoters did not think
that would best subserve the special objects they had in view.
At all events, none of them could have been prompted by any
desire to create a sort of literary aristocracy. Indeed, one would
like to know how any one in his senses could believe for a moment
that any institution of learning could be founded with
exclusive tendencies in these times, in this or any other country!
If there is an intelligent democracy anywhere it is the Republic
of Letters. It may be aristocratic in the sense that there are certain
men and women who have won fame and stand on a pedestal
above their fellows, but it is the world, not of a class, but of
all ranks and conditions, that has agreed to place them on that
pedestal as a tribute to their genius which has made people happier,
wiser and better, has delighted and instructed the artisan
as well as the noble.</p>

<p>For twelve years then the Royal Society has continued to
persevere in its work; and thanks to the encouragement given
it by the government of Canada it has been able, year by year, to
publish a large and handsome volume of the proceedings and
transactions of its meetings. No other country in the world can
exhibit volumes more creditable on the whole in point of workmanship
than those of this society. The papers and monographs
that have appeared embrace a wide field of literature&mdash;the whole
range of arch&#230;ological, ethnological, historical, geographical, biological,
mathematical and physical studies. The volumes now
are largely distributed throughout Canada&mdash;among the educated
and thinking classes&mdash;and are sent to every library, society, university
and learned institution of note in the world, with the
hope of making the Dominion better known. The countries
where they are placed for purposes of reference are these:</p>

<p>So well known are these 'Transactions' now in every country
that, when it happens some library or institution has not received
it from the beginning or has been forgotten in the distribution,
the officers of the society have very soon received an
intimation of the fact. This is gratifying, since it shows that
the world of higher literature and of special research&mdash;the world
of scholars and scientists engaged in important observation and
investigation&mdash;is interested in the work that is being done in
the same branches in this relatively new country. It would be
impossible for me within the limits of this address to give you
anything like an accurate and comprehensive idea of the numerous
papers the subject and treatment of which, even from a
largely practical and utilitarian point of view, have been of
decided value to Canada, and I can only say here that the members
of the society have endeavoured to bring to the consideration
of the subjects they have discussed a spirit of conscientious
study and research, and that, too, without any fee or reward
except that stimulating pleasure which work of an intellectual
character always brings to the mind.</p>

<p>In these days of critical comparative science, when the study
of the aboriginal or native languages of this continent has absorbed
the attention of close students, the Royal Society has endeavoured
to give encouragement and currency to those studies
by publishing grammars, vocabularies and other monographs
relating to Indian tongues and antiquities. The Abb&#233; Cuoq,
one of the most erudite scholars of this continent in this special
branch of knowledge, has nearly completed in the 'Transactions'
what will be a monumental work of learning on the Algonquin
language. A Haida grammar and dictionary are also now awaiting
the completion of the Abb&#233; Cuoq's work to be published in
the same way. A great deal of light has been thrown on Cartier's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and Champlain's voyages in the gulf, and consequently on
its cartography, by the labours of the Abb&#233; Verreau, Prof. Ganong
and others. The excellent work of the Geological Survey has
been supplemented by important contributions from its staff, and
consequently there is to be found in the 'Transactions' a large
amount of information, both abstract and practical, on the economic
and other minerals of the Dominion. Chiefly owing to the
efforts of the society, the government of Canada some time ago
commenced to take tidal observations on the Atlantic coasts of
Canada&mdash;an enterprise of great value to the shipping and commercial
interests of the country&mdash;and has also co-operated in the
determination of the true longitude of Montreal which is now
being prosecuted under the able superintendence of Professor
McLeod. It is in the same practical spirit of investigation and
action that the society has published a treatise by that veteran
scholar, Dr. Moses Harvey, of St. John's, Newfoundland, on "The
Artificial Propagation of Marine Food-fishes and Edible Crustaceans";
and it is satisfactory to understand from a statement
made in the House of Commons last session that a question of
such deep interest to our great fishing industry in the maritime
provinces is likely to result in some practical measure in the
direction suggested. The contributions of Sir Daniel Wilson on
the "Artistic Faculty in the Aboriginal Races," "The Pre-Aryan
American Man," "The Trade and Commerce of the Stone Age,"
and "The Huron-Iroquois Race in Canada," that typical race of
American Indians, were all intended to supplement in a measure
that scholarly work, "Prehistoric Man," which had brought him
fame many years before. Dr. Patterson of Nova Scotia, a most
careful student of the past, has made valuable contributions to
the history of Portuguese exploration in North American waters,
and of that remarkable lost tribe known as Beothiks or Red Indians
of Newfoundland. Sir William Dawson has contributed to
almost every volume of the 'Transactions' from his stores of
geological learning, while his distinguished son has followed
closely in his footsteps, and has made valuable additions to our
knowledge, not only of the geology of the Northwest, but also of
the antiquities, languages and customs of the Indian tribes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
British Columbia and the adjacent islands. The opinions and
theories of Dr. Thomas Sterry Hunt on the "Taconic Question in
Geology" and the "Relations of the Taconic Series to the later
Crystalline and the Cambrian Rocks," were given at length in
the earlier volumes. Mr. G. F. Matthew, of St. John, New Brunswick,
who is a very industrious student, has elaborated a work on
the "Fauna of the St. John Group." Not only have our geological
conditions been more fully explained, but our flora, ferns, and
botany generally have been clearly set forth by Professors Lawson,
Macoun and Penhallow. All these and many other papers
of value have been illustrated by expensive plates, generally executed
by Canadian artists. The majority of the names I have just
given happen to be English Canadian, but the French language
has been represented in science by such eminent men as Hamel,
Laflamme and Deville&mdash;the two first illustrating the learning and
culture of Laval, so long associated with the best scholarship of
the province of Quebec. Without pursuing the subject further,
let me say, as one who has always endeavoured to keep the interests
of the society in view, that such monographs as I have mentioned
represent the practical value of its work, and show what
an important sphere of usefulness is invariably open to it. The
object is not to publish ephemeral newspaper or magazine articles&mdash;that
is to say, articles intended for merely popular information
or purely literary practice&mdash;but always those essays and works
of moderate compass which illustrate original research, experiment
and investigation in all branches of historical, arch&#230;ological,
ethnological and scientific studies, and which will form a
permanent and instructive reference library for scholars and students
in the same branches of thought and study all over the
world. In fact, the essays must necessarily be such as cannot be
well published except through the assistance granted by a government,
as in our case, or by the liberality of private individuals.
The society, in fact, is in its way attempting just such work as
is done by the Smithsonian Institute, on a large scale, at Washington,
so far as the publication of important transactions is concerned.
I admit that sometimes essays have appeared, but many
more are offered from time to time, better suited to the periodicals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of the day than to the pages of a work of which the object is
to perpetuate the labours of students and scholars, and not the
efforts of the mere literary amateur or trifler in <i>belles-lettres</i>. But
while there must be necessarily such limitations to the scope of
the 'Transactions,' which are largely scientific in their treatment,
room will be always made for papers on any economic, social or
ethical subject which, by their acute reasoning, sound philosophy
and originality of thought, demand the attention of students
everywhere. Such literary criticism as finds place now and
then in the dignified old 'Quarterly Review' or in the 'Contemporary'
will be printed whenever it is written by any Canadian
author with the same power of keen analysis and judicious appreciation
of the thoughts and motives of an author that we find
notably in that charming study of Tennyson's "Princess," by
S. E. Dawson,<a name="FNanchor_59_73" id="FNanchor_59_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_73" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> who is a Canadian by birth, education and feeling.
No doubt there is room in the Dominion for a magazine
combining the features of 'Blackwood,' the 'Contemporary' and
the 'Quarterly Review'; that is to say, poetry, fiction, criticism,
reviews of topics of the day, and, in fact, original literary effort
of the higher order, which, though mostly ephemeral in its character,
must have much influence for the time being on the culture
and the education of the public mind. Since the days of
the old 'Canadian Monthly,'<a name="FNanchor_60_74" id="FNanchor_60_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_74" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> which, with all its imperfections,
contained much excellent work, all efforts in the same direction
have been deserving of little encouragement; and, in fact, if such
a venture is to succeed hereafter it must have behind it sufficient
capital to engage the assistance of the best Canadian writers, who
now send their work to American and English periodicals. Such
a magazine must be carefully edited, and not made the dumping-ground
for the crude efforts of literary dabblers or for romantic
gush and twaddle, but must be such a judicious selection of the
best Canadian talent as will evoke comparison with the higher
class of periodicals I have mentioned. We have only one literary
paper of merit in this country, and that is 'The Week,' which,
despite all the indifference that is too apt to meet a journal not
influenced by party motives, has kept its literary aim always
before it, and endeavoured to do such a work as 'The New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Nation' has been doing for years under far greater advantages
in the neighbouring country with marked success and ability.
In the meantime, until a magazine of the character I advocate is
established, the 'Transactions of the Royal Society' cannot be
expected to occupy the same ground unless it is prepared to give
up that important field which it and the societies with which it
is associated alone can fill in this country. In one respect, indeed,
the Royal Society, in my opinion&mdash;and I have endeavoured to
impress it on my fellow-members&mdash;can reach a much larger class
of readers than it is now possible by means of its somewhat formidable
though handsomely printed and well illustrated volumes,
which necessarily are confined, for the most part, to libraries and
institutions, where they can be best consulted by students who
find it necessary to inform themselves on such Canadian subjects
as the society necessarily treats. It is quite possible that by selecting
a more convenient form, say royal octavo, and publishing the
purely scientific sections in one volume and the purely literary
department in another, a larger inducement will be given to the
public to purchase its 'Transactions' at a moderate cost and in a
more convenient shape for reading, whenever they contain monographs
or large works in which Canadians generally are interested
or on which they wish special information. Of course, in making
this change care must be taken to maintain the typographical
appearance and the character of the scientific illustrations and
the usefulness of the cartography. Not only may the Royal Society
in this way reach a larger reading public, but it may stimulate
the efforts of historic and other writers by giving them
greater facilities for obtaining special editions of their works for
general sale. As it is now, each author obtains a hundred copies
of his paper in pamphlets, sometimes more; and if the form is
now made smaller and more handy, to use a common word, he
will be induced to order a larger edition at his own cost. Even
as it is now, some four or five thousand copies of essays and
monographs&mdash;in special cases many more&mdash;are annually distributed
by authors in addition to those circulated in the bound volumes
of the 'Transactions'; and in this way any value these
works may have is considerably enhanced. If it should be decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
to continue the large form, at all events it will be in the
interest of the society, and of the author of any monograph or
history of more than ordinary value, to print it not only in the
'Transactions' but also in a smaller volume for general circulation.
Practically this would meet the object in view&mdash;the larger
distribution of the best work of the section devoted to historical
and general literature. But whether this change is adopted or
not,<a name="FNanchor_61_75" id="FNanchor_61_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_75" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> I think the Royal Society, by showing even still greater
zeal and earnestness in the work for which it was founded, by
co-operating with scholars and students throughout the Dominion,
by showing every possible sympathy with all those engaged
in the work of art, culture and education, can look forward hopefully
to the future; and all it asks from the Canadian public at
large is confidence in its work and objects, which are in no sense
selfish or exclusive, but are influenced by a sincere desire to do
what it can to promote historic truth and scientific research, and
give a stimulus in this way to the intellectual development of
this young Dominion, yet in the infancy of its literary life.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> In the course of a speech by the Earl of Derby, in answer to a farewell address
from the Royal Society, he took occasion to make some remarks with reference
to its work and usefulness, which have been given in full in the Appendix
(Note <a name="FNanchor_58A_72" id="FNanchor_58A_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_58A_72" class="fnanchor">58<i>a</i></a>) as the impartial opinion of a governor-general who always took a deep

<p>This necessarily brief review of the work of the Royal Society
could not well be left out of an address like this; and I can
now pass on to some reflections that occur to me on the general
subject.</p>

<p>In the literature of biography, so susceptible of a treatment
full of human interests and sympathies&mdash;as chatty Boswell's
"Life of Johnson," and Lockhart's "Life of Scott," notably illustrate&mdash;we
have little to show, except it be the enterprise of publishers
and the zeal of too enthusiastic friends. Nor is it necessary
to dwell on the literature of the law, which is becoming in a measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
more of a technical and less of a learned profession in the
larger sense, unless, indeed, our university schools of political
science eventually elevate it to a wider range of thought. Several
excellent books of a purely technical character have been
compiled from year to year, but no Kent, or Story, or Cooley has
yet appeared to instruct us by a luminous exposition of principle,
or breadth of knowledge. Those who know anything of Dr. Edward
Blake's great intellectual power, of his wealth of legal
learning, of his insight into the operations of political constitutions,
cannot deny that he at least could produce a work which
might equal in many respects those of the great Americans here
named; but it looks very much at present as if he, and others
I could mention, will give up their best years to the absorbing
and uncertain struggles of politics, rather than to the literature
of that profession to which they might, under different conditions,
raise imperishable memorials. From the pulpit many of us hear
from time to time eloquent and well reasoned efforts which tell
us how much even the class, necessarily most conservative in its
traditions, and confined in its teachings, has been forced by modern
tendencies to enlarge its human sympathies and widen its
intellectual horizon; but the published sermons are relatively
few in number; and while, now and then, at intervals, after a
public celebration, an important anniversary or ceremonial, or as
a sequence of a controversy on the merits or demerits of creed or
dogma, we see a pile of pamphlets on the counter of a bookstore,
we do not hear of any printed book of sermons that appears to
have entered of recent years into the domain of human thought
and discussion in the great world beyond our territorial limits.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to dwell at any length on the intellectual
standard of our legislative bodies, but shall confine myself to a
few general observations that naturally suggest themselves to an
observer of our political conditions. Now, as in all times of our
history, political life claims many strong, keen and cultured intellects,
although it is doubtful whether the tendency of our
democratic institutions is to encourage the most highly educated
organizations to venture, or remain, should once they venture, in
the agitated and unsafe sea of political passion and controversy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
The first parliament of the Dominion, and the first legislatures
of the provinces, which met after the federal union of 1867,
when the system of dual representation was permissible&mdash;a system
whose advantages are more obvious now&mdash;brought into
public life the most brilliant and astute intellects of Canada, and
it will probably be a long time before we shall again see assemblages
so distinguished for oratory, humour and intellectual
power. A federal system was, doubtless, the only one feasible
under the racial and natural conditions that met the Quebec
Conference of 1864; but, while admitting its political necessity,
we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that the great drain
its numerous legislative bodies and governments make upon the
mental resources of a limited population&mdash;a drain increased by
the abolition of dual representation&mdash;is calculated to weaken our
intellectual strength in our legislative halls, when a legislative
union would in the nature of things concentrate that strength in
one powerful current of activity and thought. A population of
five millions of people has to provide not only between six and
seven hundred representatives, who must devote a large amount
of time to the public service for inadequate compensation, but
also lieutenant-governors, judges and high officials, holding positions
requiring intellectual qualifications as well as business
capacity if they are properly filled. Apart from these considerations,
it must be remembered that the opportunities of acquiring
wealth and success in business or professional vocations
have naturally increased with the material development of the
Dominion, and that men of brains have consequently even less
inducement than formerly to enter on the uncertain and too
often ungrateful pursuit of politics. We have also the danger
before us that it will be with us, as it is in the United States
and even in England under the new conditions that are rapidly
developing there; the professional politician, who is too often
the creation of factions and cliques, and the lower influences of
political intrigue and party management, will be found, as time
passes, more common in our legislative halls, to the detriment of
those higher ideals that should be the animating principles of
public life in this young country, whose future happiness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
greatness depend so much on the present methods of party government.
Be all this as it may be, one may still fairly claim
for our legislative bodies that their intellectual standard can
compare favourably with that of the Congress at Washington or
the state legislatures of Massachusetts and New England generally.
After all, it is not for brilliant intellectual pyrotechnics
we should now so much look to the legislative bodies of Canada,
but rather for honesty of purpose, keen comprehension of the
public interests, and a business capacity which can grasp the
actual material wants and necessities of a country which has to
face the competition, and even opposition, of a great people full
of industrial as well as intellectual energy.</p>

<p>Nowhere in this review have I claimed for this country any
very striking results in the course of the half century since which
we have shown so much political and material activity. I cannot
boast that we have produced a great poem or a great history
which has attracted the attention of the world beyond us, and
assuredly we find no noteworthy attempt in the direction of a
novel of our modern life; but what I do claim is, looking at the
results generally, the work we have done has been sometimes
above the average in those fields of literature&mdash;and here I include,
necessarily, science&mdash;in which Canadians have worked.
They have shown in many productions a conscientious spirit of
research, patient industry, and not a little literary skill in the
management of their material. I think, on the whole, there have
been enough good poems, histories and essays written and published
in Canada for the last four or five decades to prove that
there has been a steady intellectual growth on the part of our
people, and that it has kept pace at all events with the mental
growth in the pulpit, or in the legislative halls, where, of late
years, a keen practical debating style has taken the place of the
more rhetorical and studied oratory of old times. I believe the
intellectual faculties of Canadians only require larger opportunities
for their exercise to bring forth a rich fruition. I believe the
progress in the years to come will be far greater than that we
have yet shown, and that necessarily so, with the wider distribution
of wealth, the dissemination of a higher culture, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
greater confidence in our own mental strength, and in the resources
that this country offers to pen and pencil. The time will
come when that great river, associated with memories of Cartier,
Champlain, La Salle, Frontenac, Wolfe and Montcalm,&mdash;that river
already immortalized in history by the pen of Parkman&mdash;will be
as noted in song and story as the Rhine, and will have its Irving
to make it as famous as the lovely Hudson.</p>

<p>Of course there are many obstacles in the way of successful
literary pursuits in Canada. Our population is still small, and
separated into two distinct nationalities, who for the most part
necessarily read books printed in their own tongue. A book
published in Canada then has a relatively limited <i>client&#232;le</i> in the
country itself, and cannot meet much encouragement from publishers
in England or in the United States who have advantages
for placing their own publications which no Canadian can have
under existing conditions. Consequently an author of ambition
and merit should perforce look for publishers outside his own
country if he is to expect anything like just appreciation, or to
have a fair chance of reaching that literary world which alone
gives fame in the true sense. It must be admitted too that so
much inferior work has at times found its way from Canada to
other countries that publishers are apt to look askance at a book
when it is offered to them from the colonies. Still, while this
may at times operate against making what is a fairly good bargain
with the publisher&mdash;and many authors, of course, believe
with reason that a publisher, as a rule, never makes a good bargain
with an author, and certainly not with a new one&mdash;a good
book will sooner or later assert itself whenever Canadians write
such a book. Let Canadians then persevere conscientiously and
confidently in their efforts to break through the indifference which
at present tends to cramp their efforts and dampen their energy.
It is a fashion with some colonial writers to believe that there
is a settled determination on the part of English critics to ignore
their best work, when, perhaps, in the majority of cases it is the
lack of good work that is at fault. Such a conclusion sometimes
finds an argument in the fact that, when so able a Canadian as
Edward Blake enters the legislative halls of England, some ill-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
critic, who represents a spirit of insular English snobbery,
has only a sneer for "this Canadian lawyer" who had
better "stay at home," and not presume to think that he, a mere
colonist, could have anything to say in matters affecting the good
government of the British Empire. But the time has long since
passed for sneers at colonial self-government or colonial intellect,
and we are more likely hereafter to have a Canadian House of
Commons held up as a model of decorum for so-called English
gentlemen. Such able and impartial critical journals as <i>The
Athen&#230;um</i> are more ready to welcome than ignore a good book in
these days of second-rate literature in England itself. If we produce
such a good book as Mrs. Campbell Praed's "Australian
Life," or Tasma's "Uncle Piper of Piper's Hill," we may be sure
the English papers will do us justice. Let me frankly insist that
we have far too much hasty and slovenly literary work done in
Canada. The literary canon which every ambitious writer should
have ever in his mind has been stated by no less an authority
than Sainte-Beuve: "Devoted to my profession as a critic, I have
tried to be more and more a good and if possible an able workman."
A good style means artistic workmanship. It is too soon
for us in this country to look for a Matthew Arnold or a Sainte-Beuve&mdash;such
great critics are generally the results, and not the
forerunners, of a great literature; but at least if we could have
in the present state of our intellectual development, a criticism in
the press which would be truthful and just, the essential characteristics
of the two authors I have named, the effect would be
probably in the direction of encouraging promising writers, and
weeding out some literary dabblers. "What I have wished,"
said the French critic, "is to say not a word more than I thought,
to stop even a little short of what I believed in certain cases, in
order that my words might acquire more weight as historical testimony."
Truth tempered by consideration for literary genius is
the essence of sound criticism.</p>

<p>We all know that the literary temperament is naturally sensitive
to anything like indifference and is too apt, perhaps, to
exaggerate the importance of its calling in the prosaic world in
which it is exercised. The pecuniary rewards are so few, relatively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
in this country, that the man of imaginative mind&mdash;the
purely literary worker&mdash;naturally thinks that he can, at least, ask
for generous appreciation. No doubt he thinks, to quote a passage
from a clever Australian novel&mdash;"The Australian Girl"&mdash;"Genius
has never been truly acclimatized by the world. The
Philistines always long to put out the eyes of poets and make
them grind corn in Gaza." But it is well always to remember
that a great deal of rough work has to be done in a country like
Canada before its Augustan age can come. No doubt literary
stimulus must be more or less wanting in a colony where there
is latent at times in some quarters a want of self-confidence in
ourselves and in our institutions, arising from that sense of dependency
and habit of imitation and borrowing from others that
is a necessity of a colonial condition. The tendency of the absence
of sufficient self-assertion is to cramp intellectual exertion, and
make us believe that success in literature can only be achieved
in the old countries of Europe. That spirit of all-surrounding
materialism to which Lowell has referred must also always exercise
a certain sinister influence in this way&mdash;an influence largely
exerted in Ontario&mdash;but despite all this we see that even among
our neighbours it has not prevented the growth of a literary class
famous for its intellectual successes in varied fields of literature.
It is for Canadian writers to have always before them a high ideal,
and remember that literature does best its duty&mdash;to quote the
eloquent words of Ruskin&mdash;"in raising our fancy to the height of
what may be noble, honest and felicitous in actual life; in giving
us, though we may be ourselves poor and unknown, the companionship
of the wisest spirits of every age and country, and in
aiding the communication of clear thoughts and faithful purposes
among distant nations, which will at last breathe calm upon the
sea of lawless passion and change into such halcyon days the
winter of the world, that the birds of the air may have their nests
in peace and the Son of Man where to lay his head."</p>

<p>Largely, if not entirely, owing to the expansion of our common
school system&mdash;admirable in Ontario and Nova Scotia, but
defective in Quebec&mdash;and the influence of our universities and
colleges, the average intelligence of the people of this country is
much higher than it was a very few years ago; but no doubt it
is with us as with our neighbours&mdash;to quote the words of an eminent
public speaker whose brilliancy sometimes leads one to forget
his higher criticism&mdash;I refer to Dr. Chauncey Depew&mdash;"Speed is
the virtue and vice of our generation. We demand that morning-glories
and century plants shall submit to the same conditions
and flower with equal frequency." Even some of our universities
from which we naturally expect so much seem disposed from
time to time to lower their standard and yield too readily to the
demand for purely practical education when, after all, the great
reason of all education is to draw forth the best qualities of the
young man, elevate his intelligence, and stimulate his highest
intellectual forces. The animating principle with the majority of
people is to make a young man a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer,
or teach him some other vocation as soon as possible, and the tendency
is to consider any education that does not immediately
effect that result as superfluous. Whilst every institution of
learning must necessarily yield something to this pervading
spirit of immediate utility, it would be a mistake to sacrifice all
the methods and traditions of the past when sound scholars at
least were made, and the world had so many men famous in
learning, in poetry, in romance, and in history. For one I range
myself among those who, like James Russell Lowell and Matthew
Arnold, still consider the conscientious and intelligent study of
the ancient classics&mdash;the humanities as they are called&mdash;as best
adapted to create cultured men and women, and as the noblest
basis on which to build up even a practical education with which
to earn bread and capture the world. Goldwin Smith very truly
says, "A romantic age stands in need of science, a scientific and
utilitarian age stands in need of the humanities."<a name="FNanchor_62_76" id="FNanchor_62_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_76" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The study of
Greek, above all others of the humanities, is calculated to stimulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the higher qualities of our nature. As Matthew Arnold adds
in the same discourse from which I have quoted, "The instinct
for beauty is set in human nature, as surely as the instinct for
knowledge is set there, or the instinct for conduct. If the instinct
for beauty is served by Greek literature and art as it is served by
no other literature or art, we may trust to the instinct of self-preservation
in humanity for keeping Greek as part of our culture."
With the same great critic and thinker, I hope that in
Canada "Greek will be increasingly studied as men feel the need
in them for beauty, and how powerfully Greek art and Greek
literature can serve this need." We are as respects the higher
education of this country in that very period which Arnold saw
ahead for America&mdash;"a period of unsettlement and confusion and
false tendency"&mdash;a tendency to crowd into education too many
matters; and it is for this reason I venture to hope that letters
will not be allowed to yield entirely to the necessity for practical
science, the importance of which I fully admit, while deprecating
it being made the dominant principle in our universities. If we
are to come down to the lower grades of our educational system
I might also doubt whether despite all its decided advantages
for the masses&mdash;its admirable machinery and apparatus, its comfortable
school-houses, its varied systematic studies from form to
form and year to year, its well managed normal and model schools,
its excellent teachers&mdash;there are not also signs of superficiality.
The tendency of the age is to become rich fast, to get as much
knowledge as possible within a short time, and the consequence
of this is to spread far too much knowledge over a limited ground&mdash;to
give a child too many subjects, and to teach him a little of
everything. These are days of many cyclop&#230;dias, historical summaries,
scientific digests, reviews of reviews, French in a few lessons,
and interest tables. All is digested and made easy to the
student. Consequently not a little of the production of our schools
and of some of our colleges may be compared to a veneer of knowledge,
which easily wears off in the activities of life, and leaves
the roughness of the original and cheaper material very perceptible.
One may well believe that the largely mechanical system
and materialistic tendency of our education has some effect in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
checking the development of a really original and imaginative
literature among us. Much of our daily literature&mdash;indeed the
chief literary aliment of large classes of our busy population is
the newspaper press, which illustrates in many ways the haste
and pressure of this life of ours in a country of practical needs like
Canada. When we consider the despatch with which a large
newspaper has to be made up, how reports are caught on the
wing and published without sufficient verification, how editorials
have to be written <i>currente calamo</i>, and often after midnight when
important despatches come in, we may well wonder that the daily
issue of a newspaper is so well done. With the development of
confederation the leading Canadian papers have taken, through
the influence of the new condition of things, a larger range of
thought and expression, and the gross personalities which so frequently
discredited the press before 1867 have now become the
exception. If I might refer to an old and enterprising paper as
an example of the new order of things, I should point to the
Toronto <i>Globe</i> under its present editorial management and compare
it with two or three decades ago. It will be seen there is a
deeper deference to an intelligent public opinion by an acknowledgment
of the right of a community to hear argument and
reason even on matters of party politics, and to have fair reports
of speeches on both sides of a question. In point of appearance,
make-up, and varied literary matter&mdash;especially in its literary
department, its criticisms of new books in all branches of literature&mdash;the
Australasian press is decidedly superior to that of
Canada as a rule. The Melbourne <i>Argus</i> and the Sydney <i>Herald</i>
compare with the best London journals, and the reason is mainly
because there is no country press in Australia to limit the enterprise
and energy of a newspaper publisher. Perhaps it is as well
for the general instruction of a community like ours that there
should be a large and active country press, and the people not
too much under the guidance of a few great journals in important
centres of political thought and action. For one I have more faith
in the good sense and reason of the community as a whole than
in the motives and disinterestedness of a few leaders in one or
more cities or towns. But I must also add that when we consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the influence a widely disseminated press like that of Canada
must exercise on the opinions and sentiments of the large body
of persons of whom it is the principal or only literature, one
must wish that there was more independence of thought and
honesty of criticism as well as a greater willingness, or capacity
rather, to study a high ideal on the part of the press generally.
However improved the tone of the Canadian press may have become
of late years, however useful it may be as a daily record
of passing events&mdash;of course, outside of party politics&mdash;however
ably it may discuss in its editorial columns the topics of the day,
it is not yet an influence always calculated to strengthen the
mind and bring out the best intellectual faculties of a reader like
a book which is the result of calm reflection, sound philosophic
thought, originality of idea, or the elevated sentiment of the great
poet or the historian. As a matter of fact a newspaper is too
often in Canada a reflex of the average rather than of the higher
intelligence of the country, and on no other ground can we explain
the space devoted to a football match, or a prize fight, or a
murder trial, or degrading incidents in the criminal life of men
and women. For one, I am an admirer of athletic and other
sports calculated to develop health and muscle, as long as they
are not pursued to extremes, do not become the end and aim of
youth, or allowed to degenerate into brutality. All of us do not
forget the great influence of the Olympian, the Pythian and other
public games on the Greek character when the land was "living
Greece" indeed; but we must also remember that art and song
had a part in those contests of athletes, that they even inspired
the lyric odes of Pindar, that the poet there recited his drama or
epic, the painter exhibited his picture, and the intellectual was
made a part of the physical struggle in those palmy days of Greek
culture. I have not yet heard that any Canadian poet or painter
or historian has ever been so honoured, or asked to take part in
those athletic games and sports to which our public journals devote
a number of pages which have not yet been set apart for
Canadian or any literature. The newspaper reporter is nowadays
the only representative of literature in our Pythia or Olympia,
and he assuredly cannot be said to be a Pindaric singer when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
exalts the triumphs of lacrosse or the achievements of the baseball
champion.</p>

<p>In drawing to a conclusion I come now to refer to a subject
which is naturally embraced in an address intended to review
the progress of culture in this country, and that is what should
have, perhaps, been spoken of before, the condition of Art in the
Dominion. As our public libraries<a name="FNanchor_63_77" id="FNanchor_63_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_77" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> are small compared with
those in the neighbouring union, and confined to three or four
cities&mdash;Montreal being in some respects behind Toronto&mdash;so our
public and private art galleries are very few in number and insignificant
as respects the value and the greatness of the paintings.
Even in the House of Commons, not long since, regret was
expressed at the smallness of the Dominion contribution, one
thousand dollars only, for the support of a so-called National Art
Gallery at Ottawa, and the greater part of this paltry sum, it
appeared, went to pay, not the addition of good paintings, but
actually the current expenses of keeping it up. Hopes were
thrown out by more than one member of the government, in the
course of the discussion on the subject, that ere long a much
larger amount would be annually voted to make the gallery
more representative of the best Canadian art, and it was very
properly suggested that it should be the rule to purchase a number
of Canadian pictures regularly every year, and in this way
stimulate the talent of our artists. Montreal at present has one
fairly good museum of art, thanks to the liberality of two or three
of her rich men, but so public spirited a city as Toronto, which
numbers among its citizens a number of artists of undoubted
merit, is conspicuous for its dearth of good pictures even in private
collections, and for the entire absence of any public gallery.
In Montreal there are also some very valuable and representative
paintings of foreign artists in the residences of her wealthy men
of business; but whilst it is necessary that we should have
brought to this country from time to time such examples of artistic
genius to educate our own people for better things, it is still
desirable that Canadian millionaires and men of means and taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
should encourage the best efforts of our own artists. It is said
sometimes&mdash;and there is some truth in the remark&mdash;that Canadian
art hitherto has been imitative rather than creative; but
while we have pictures like those of L. R. O'Brien, W. Brymner,
F. A. Verner, O. R. Jacobi, George Reid, F. M. Bell-Smith, Homer
Watson, W. Raphael, Robert Harris, C. M. Manly, J. W. L. Forster,
A. D. Patterson, Miss Bell, Miss Muntz, J. Pinhey, J. C. Forbes,
Paul Peel&mdash;a young man of great promise too soon cut off&mdash;and of
other excellent painters,<a name="FNanchor_64_78" id="FNanchor_64_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_78" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> native born or adopted Canadians,
illustrating in many cases, as do those of Mr. O'Brien notably, the
charm and picturesqueness of Canadian scenery, it would seem
that only sufficient encouragement is needed to develop a higher
order of artistic performance among us. The Marquess of Lorne
and the Princess Louise, during their too short residence in the
Dominion, did something to stimulate a larger and better taste
for art by the establishment of a Canadian Academy and the holding
of several exhibitions; but such things can be of little practical
utility if Canadians do not encourage the artists who are to
contribute. It is to be hoped that the same spirit of generosity
which is yearly building commodious science halls, and otherwise
giving our universities additional opportunities for usefulness,
will also ere long establish at least one fine art gallery in
each of the older provinces, to illustrate not simply English and
Foreign art, but the most original and highly executed work of
Canadians themselves. Such galleries are so many object lessons&mdash;like
that wondrous "White City" which has arisen by a
western lake as suddenly as the palaces of eastern story&mdash;to educate
the eye, form the taste and develop the higher faculties of
our nature amid the material surroundings of our daily life. No
doubt the creative and imaginative faculties of our people have
not yet been developed to any noteworthy extent; the poems and
paintings of native Canadians too frequently lack, and the little
fiction so far written is entirely destitute of the essential elements
of successful and permanent work in art and literature. But the
deficiency in this respect has arisen not from the poverty of Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
intellect, but rather from the absence of that general distribution
of wealth on which art can alone thrive, the consequent
want of galleries to cultivate a taste among the people for the
best artistic productions, and above all from the existence of that
spirit of intellectual self-depreciation which is essentially colonial,
and leads not a few to believe that no good work of this kind can
be done in mere dependencies.</p>

<p>The exhibition of American art at the world's fair is remarkable
on the whole for individual expression, excellent colour and
effective composition. It proves to a demonstration that the
tendency is progressive, and that it is not too much to expect
that a few decades hence this continent will produce a Corot, a
Daubigny, a Bonnat, a Bouguereau or a Millais. Not the least
gratifying feature of the exhibition has been the revelation to the
foreign world&mdash;and probably to many Canadians as well&mdash;that
there is already some artistic performance of a much higher order
than was believed to exist in Canada, and that it has been
adjudged worthy of special mention among the masterpieces that
surround the paintings of our artists. This success, very moderate
as it is, must stimulate Canadian painters to still greater
efforts in the future, and should help to create a wider interest
in their work among our own people, heretofore too indifferent
to the labours of men and women, whose rewards have been
small in comparison with the conscientiousness and earnestness
they have given to the prosecution of their art.</p>

<p>The opportunities which Canadian artists have had of comparing
their own work with that of the most artistic examples at
the exhibition should be beneficial if they have made of them
the best possible use. American and French art was particularly
well represented at the exhibition, and was probably most interesting
from a Canadian point of view, since our artists would
naturally make comparisons with their fellow-workers on this
continent, and at the same time closely study the illustrations of
those French schools which now attract the greater number of
students from this country, and have largely influenced&mdash;perhaps
too much so at times&mdash;the later efforts of some well-known painters
among us. A writer in the New York <i>Nation</i> has made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
comparisons between the best works of the artists of France and
the United States, which are supported by the testimony of critics
who are able to speak with authority on the subject. The French
notably excel "in seriousness of purpose and general excellence
of work from a technical point of view, especially in the thorough
knowledge of construction in both the figure and landscape pictures."
On the other hand, the artists of the United States
"show more diversity of aim and individuality of expression, as
well as colour feeling." Some two or three Canadian artists give
examples of those very qualities&mdash;especially in their landscapes&mdash;which,
according to the New York critic, distinguish the illustrations
of the art of the United States. As a rule, however, there
is a want of individuality of expression, and of perfection of
finish, in the work of Canadian artists, as even their relatively
imperfect representation at Chicago has shown. The tendency
to be imitative rather than creative is too obvious. Canadian
painters show even a readiness to leave their own beautiful and
varied scenery that they may portray that of other countries, and
in doing so they have ceased in many cases to be original. But
despite these defects, there is much hope in the general performance
of Canadians even without that encouragement and sympathy
which the artists of the United States have in a larger
measure been able to receive in a country of greater wealth, population
and intellectual culture.</p>

<p>Not only does the exhibition of paintings in the world's fair
make one very hopeful of the future artistic development of this
continent, but the beauty of the architectural design of the noble
buildings which contain the treasures of art and industry, and
of the decorative figures and groups of statuary that embellish
these buildings and the surrounding grounds, is a remarkable
illustration of the artistic genius that has produced so exquisite
an effect in general, whatever defects there may be in minor
details. A critic in the July number of the 'Quarterly Review,'
while writing "in the presence of these lovely temples, domes,
and colonnades under the burning American sky which adds a
light and a transparency to all it rests upon," cannot help echoing
the regret that this vision of beauty is but for a season, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
expressing the hope that some one of the American money kings
"may perpetuate his name on marble, by restoring, on the edge
of this immense capital, amid parks and waters, that great central
square which, were it only built of enduring materials, would
stand without a rival in modern architecture." Perhaps the fine
arts in the Dominion&mdash;where sculpture would be hardly heard
of were it not for the French Canadian H&#233;bert&mdash;may themselves
even gain some stimulus from the examples of a higher conception
of artistic achievement that is shown by this exhibition to exist
in a country where a spirit of materialism has obtained the mastery
so long. Canadian architecture hitherto has not been distinguished
for originality of design&mdash;much more than art it has
been imitative. In Montreal and Quebec the old buildings which
represent the past have no architectural beauty, however interesting
they may be to the antiquarian or the historian, and however
well many of them harmonize with the heights of picturesque
Quebec. Montreal is assuredly the most interesting city
from an architectural point of view in Canada, simply for the
reason that its architects have, as a rule, studied that effect of
solidity and simplicity of design most in keeping with the grand
mountain and the natural scenery that give such picturesqueness
to an exceptionally noble site. While we see all over Canada&mdash;from
Victoria on the Pacific to Halifax on the Atlantic<a name="FNanchor_64A_79" id="FNanchor_64A_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_64A_79" class="fnanchor">[64<i>a</i>]</a><a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>&mdash;the
evidences of greater comfort, taste and wealth in our private and
public buildings, while we see many elaborate specimens of ecclesiastical
art, stately piles of legislative halls, excellent specimens
of Gothic and Tudor art in our colleges, expensive commercial
and financial structures, and even civic palaces, yet they are
often illustrative of certain well defined and prevalent types of
architecture in the eastern and western cities of the United
States. It cannot be said that Canada has produced an architect
of original genius like Henry Hobson Richardson, who was cut
off in the commencement of his career, but not before he had given
the continent some admirable specimens of architectural art, in
which his study of the Romanesque was specially conspicuous,
and probably led the way to a higher ideal which has reached some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
realization in the city which must too soon disappear like the
fabric of a vision, though one can well believe that, unlike a
dream, it will leave a permanent impress on the intellectual
development of the people who have conceived an exhibition so
creditable from a purely artistic point of view.</p>

<p>The Dominion of Canada possesses a noble heritage which
has descended to us as the result of the achievement of Frenchmen,
Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen, who through centuries
of trial and privation, showed an indomitable courage,
patience and industry which it is our duty to imitate with the
far greater opportunities we now enjoy of developing the latent
material and intellectual resources of this fair land. Possessing
a country rich in natural treasures and a population inheriting
the institutions, the traditions and qualities of their ancestors,
having a remarkable capacity for self-government, enjoying exceptional
facilities for the acquisition of knowledge, having
before us always the record of difficulties overcome against great
odds in endeavouring to establish ourselves on this continent,
we may well in the present be animated by the spirit of hope,
rather than by that feeling of despair which some despondent
thinkers and writers have too frequently on their lips when it is
a question of the destiny in store for Canada. In the course of
the coming decades&mdash;perhaps in four or five, or less&mdash;Canada
will probably have determined her destiny&mdash;her position among
the communities of the world; and, for one, I have no doubt the
results will be far more gratifying to our national pride than the
results of even the past thirty years, when we have been laying
broad and deep the foundations of our present system of government.
We have reason to believe that the material success of this
confederation will be fully equalled by the intellectual efforts of
a people who have sprung from nations whose not least enduring
fame has been the fact that they have given to the world of
letters a Shakespeare, a Moli&#232;re, a Montesquieu, a Balzac, a
Dickens, a Dudevant, a Tennyson, a Victor Hugo, a Longfellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
a Hawthorne, a Th&#233;ophile Gauthier, and many other names that
represent the best literary genius of the English and French races.
All the evidence before us now goes to prove that the French
language will continue into an indefinite future to be the language
of a large and influential section of the population of
Canada, and that it must consequently exercise a decided influence
on the culture and intellect of the Dominion. It has been
within the last four decades that the best intellectual work&mdash;both
in literature and statesmanship&mdash;has been produced in French
and English Canada, and the signs of intellectual activity in the
same direction do not lessen with the expansion of the Dominion.
The history of England from the day the Norman came into the
island until he was absorbed in the original Saxon element, is
not likely to be soon repeated in Canada, but in all probability
the two nationalities will remain side by side for an unknown
period to illustrate on the northern half of the continent of America
the culture and genius of the two strongest and brightest
powers of civilization. As both of these nationalities have vied
with each other in the past to build up this confederation on a
large and generous basis of national strength and greatness, and
have risen time and again superior to those racial antagonisms
created by differences of opinion at great crises of our history&mdash;antagonisms
happily dispelled by the common sense, reason and
patriotism of men of both races&mdash;so we should in the future hope
for that friendly rivalry on the part of the best minds among
French and English Canadians which will best stimulate the
genius of their people in art, history, poetry and romance. In
the meantime, while this confederation is fighting its way out of
its political difficulties, and resolving wealth and refinement
from the original and rugged elements of a new country, it is for
the respective nationalities not to stand aloof from one another,
but to unite in every way possible for common intellectual improvement,
and give sympathetic encouragement to the study of
the two languages and to the mental efforts of each other. It
was on this enlightened principle of sympathetic interest that
the Royal Society was founded and on which alone it can expect
to obtain any permanent measure of success. If the English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
French always endeavour to meet each other on this friendly
basis in all the communities where they live side by side as well
as on all occasions that demand common thought and action and
cultivate that social and intellectual intercourse which may at
all events weld them both as one in spirit and aspiration, however
different they may continue in language and temperament,
many prejudices must be removed, social life must gain in charm,
and intellect must be developed by finding strength where it is
weak, and grace where it is needed in the mental efforts of the
two races. If in addition to this widening of the sympathies of
our two national elements, we can see in the Dominion generally
less of that provincialism which means a narrowness of mental
vision on the part of our literary aspirants, and prevents Canadian
authors reaching a larger audience in other countries, then
we shall rise superior to those weaknesses of our intellectual
character which now impede our mental development, and shall
be able to give larger scope to what original and imaginative
genius may exist among our people. So with the expansion of
our mental horizon, with the growth of experience and knowledge,
with the creation of a wider sympathy for native talent,
with the disappearance of that tendency to self-depreciation
which is so essentially colonial, and with the encouragement of
more self-reliance and confidence in our own intellectual resources,
we may look forward with some degree of hopefulness
to conditions of higher development, and to the influence on our
national character of what can best elevate Canadians and make
them even happier and wiser,</p>

from which I quote in the commencement of the text, should be carefully read and
studied by all those who are interested in education and culture in the Dominion,
and do not wish to see the classics superseded by purely scientific and utilitarian
theories. "Leave," he said, for instance, "in their traditional pre-eminence those
arts that were rightly called liberal; those studies that kindle the imagination, and
through it irradiate the reason: those studies that manumitted the modern mind;
those in which the brains of the finest temper have found alike their stimulus and
their repose, taught by them that the power of intellect is heightened in proportion
as it is made gracious by measure and symmetry. Give us science, too, but give,
first of all and last of all, the science that ennobles life and makes it generous....
Many-sidedness of culture makes your vision clearer and keener in particulars.
For, after all, the noblest definition of Science is that breadth and impartiality of
view which liberates the mind from specialties, and enables it to organize whatever
we learn, so that it becomes real Knowledge by being brought into true and helpful
relation with the rest."</p>

<p>It is Captain John Smith of Virginia who, among the colonizers of America, can
best compare with the founder of Quebec. The following estimate of his character,
given by the historian George Bancroft (i., 138&ndash;139, ed. of 1866), could be applied in
almost every particular to the Frenchman; all we need do is to read "New France"
for "Virginia," "French" for "Saxon," "France" for "England," etc.: "He was
the father of Virginia, the true leader who first planted the Saxon race within the
borders of the United States. His judgment had ever been clear in the midst of
general despondency. He united the highest spirit of adventure with consummate
powers of action. His courage and self-possession accomplished what others esteemed
desperate. Fruitful in expedients, he was prompt in execution. Though he had
been harassed by the persecutions of malignant envy, he never revived the memory
of the faults of his enemies. He was accustomed to lead, not to send his men to
danger; would suffer want rather than borrow, and starve sooner than not pay. He
had nothing counterfeit in his nature, but was open, honest and sincere. He clearly
discerned that it was the true interest of England not to seek in Virginia for gold
and hidden wealth, but to enforce regular industry. 'Nothing,' said he, 'is to be
expected thence but by labour.'"</p>

lived long with the Iroquois. Charlevoix said of his book, twenty years later, 'We
have nothing so exact on the subject;' and Lafitau continues to hold high rank as
an original authority, though his book is overlaid with a theory of Tartaric origin of
the red race. Mr. Parkman calls him 'the most satisfactory of the elder writers.'"
Garneau, ii., 154, mentions that he discovered in 1716 a plant in the Canadian forests
which is of the nature of ginseng, which for awhile was a valuable article of export
to Canton. Eventually it became valueless in China on account of its being prepared

Finland, and a member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences. His Travels in
North America ("In Risa tel Nord America"), 1748&ndash;51, first appeared in Swedish
(Stockholm, 1753&ndash;61), and subsequently in a translation, with the original somewhat
abridged, by John Reinhold Forster (Warrington and London, 1770; 2nd ed., 1772).
A translation in French by L. W. Marchand has also been published, and it is
from that I quote in the text. (For German and Dutch versions see 'Nar. and Crit.
Hist. Am.,' v., 244.) I have since found that Forster, in a note (ii., 185, 2nd ed.) on
the remarks of the Swedish savant with respect to the study of science in the English
colonies, calls attention to the fact that "Mr. Kalm has forgotten his own assertions
in the former part of this work." Dr. Colden, Dr. Franklin and Mr. Bartram,
he continues, "have been the great promoters and investigators of nature in this
country, and how would the inhabitants have gotten the fine collections of North
American trees, shrubs and plants, which grow at present almost in every garden,
and are as if they were naturalized in old England, had they not been assisted by
their friends and by the curious in North America." Forster also refers to the
schools, colleges and libraries already existing in the English colonies as evidence
that Kalm hardly did justice to the men of culture in those countries. No doubt
La Galissoni&#232;re, Sarrazin, Gauthier, and others created, for a time certainly, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
interest in the practical pursuit of science in Canada. The interest, however, must
have been necessarily confined to a very small class in the two or three towns and
garrisons to which La Galissoni&#232;re's influence extended. Some of the Jesuit priests
like Lafitau (see note 11<i>a</i>) had a taste for natural history, and have left us much information
on the subject. But Lafitau, La Galissoni&#232;re, Gauthier, Sarrazin and
others were not native Canadians, though, like Charlevoix and his predecessors who
wrote of the country, they have left imperishable memorials connecting their names
with the literary and scientific history of New France. On the other hand, Franklin,
Bartram, Stith, the Mathers and Beverley, whose names will be always associated
with the early culture of science and literature in the old English colonies, were
American by birth and education. Still these men represented a very insignificant
influence in the practical, money-making population of New England and the
middle colonies of which Kalm chiefly spoke. Their influence would be relatively
trifling compared with that which was necessarily exercised by a governor like
La Galissoni&#232;re in New France, with its sympathetic officials and priests, and which
was necessarily contrasted by Kalm with the indifference of the English colonists.
Kalm failed, however, to recognize the public liberty, commercial enterprise and
secular education which in New England and other colonial communities gave the
people the advantage over the habitans and French Canadians generally. Instead,
the spirit of materialism that was a distinguishing feature of the active, enterprising
English colonists, must have grated on the susceptibilities of a student like
Kalm, and prevented him from doing impartial justice to the strong qualities of a
rising nation.</p>

Canada Fifty Years Ago" (Toronto, 1885), and Bourinot's "Intellectual Development
of the Canadian People" (12mo., Toronto, and 'Canadian Monthly,' 1881). At the
present time there are 14 universities and 29 colleges in which a classical education
is given; 6 ladies' colleges, and 5 agricultural colleges and schools of science. The
value of their buildings, endowments, etc., is upwards of $12,000,000, and the attendance
is about 9,000 students. The classical colleges of Quebec&mdash;which make up the
greater number of the colleges in Canada&mdash;are a combination of school and college
attended by both boys and young men. They confer certain degrees and are generally
affiliated with Laval University. The effect of the classical studies encouraged
in these colleges is very perceptible in the culture of the well educated French Canadian.
At present there are in Canada upwards of 17,000 public, high, normal, and
model schools, attended by about 1,000,000 pupils, and costing a total annual expenditure
of between six and seven millions of dollars. In Ontario (once Upper Canada)
there are 16 universities and colleges, including ladies' and agricultural colleges;
about 6,000 schools of all kinds, attended by over 500,000 pupils, and costing annually
over $4,000,000. See "The Statistical Year-Book of Canada," Ottawa, 1893.</p>

Bourinot's "Intellectual Development of the Canadian People" (Toronto, 1881); also
in Dr. Canniff's "History of the Province of Ontario" (Toronto, 1872), and in "Sketch

1892). Some of the statements in this article appear to require verification. I
have now in my possession a copy of the 'York Gazette' printed in July, 1815, though
Mr. Biggar states that no paper was published in York after the capture of the town
by the American troops and the destruction of the press and type, in 1813, until 1817.
The 'York Gazette' was originally the 'Upper Canada Gazette, or American Oracle,'
first printed in 1793 at Niagara (Newark), when it was the political capital of Upper
Canada after the passage of the Constitutional Act of 1791. It was removed to York
(Toronto) in 1800, and became the 'York Gazette' a few years later. At the present
time there are in Ontario alone, of daily papers, 47; weekly, 386. In the Dominion
there are 98 daily papers, 1,035 weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc. In 1838 there were
in all British North America not more than 70 papers, of which 38 were in Upper
Canada. In 1864 the total was about a quarter of the present number.</p>

a bookseller without the least aptitude for business. He left Quebec after his failure,
and lived under an assumed name in France, where he died in poverty. His life
was most unfortunate, and in the gloomy days of his later French career he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
realized the expectations which his literary efforts in Canada raised among his ardent
friends. His poems appeared at first in the 'Soir&#233;es Canadiennes' and French
Canadian journals, but his works were published in full at Montreal, in 1882, under
the patronage of the Institut Canadien of Quebec, of which he was one of the
founders. The Abb&#233; Casgrain has given the introduction for this edition, and added
some of the letters written to him by Cr&#233;mazie from Paris. Cr&#233;mazie, and indeed
many of his friends, considered the "Trois Morts" as the best effort of his poetic
genius; but the Abb&#233; truly says: "Cr&#233;mazie has never really been original except
in his patriotic poems; in them must be sought the secret of his popularity and his
strongest claim to fame." And he goes on to say: "The old mother-country has
so far given a warm welcome to only one of our poets. She has acknowledged Fr&#233;chette
as the most emphatically French of our poetic aspirants; but the time is not
far distant when she will recognize in Cr&#233;mazie the most thoroughly Canadian of
them all. His verses have not the exquisite workmanship that is so much admired
in Fr&#233;chette, but it is full of a patriotic inspiration that is not so often found in
the author of 'Fleurs Bor&#233;ales.' Despite his inequalities and imperfections, Cr&#233;mazie
must live among us as the father of our national poetry." The patriotic
poem which has touched most deeply the hearts of his countrymen is "Le Drapeau
de Carillon," in which he recalls the military achievements of the days of L&#233;vis and
Montcalm&mdash;</p>

<p>"L&#233;gendes Canadiennes." Quebec, 1861, 12mo. New ed., Montreal, 1884.</p>

<p>"Histoire de la M&#232;re Marie de l'Incarnation, premi&#232;re sup&#233;rieure des Ursulines

<p>The Abb&#233; has been a most industrious historical student, and to enumerate all
his literary efforts would be to occupy much space. He has been a principal contributor
to the 'Trans. Roy. Soc. Can.' His monographs, "Un p&#232;lerinage au pays
d'Evangeline" (vol. iv.) and "Les Acadiens apr&#232;s leur dispersion" (vol. v.), are particularly
interesting, and the former has been crowned by the French Academy, and
appeared in book form at Quebec. He is very much imbued with the national spirit
and fervour of his countrymen.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_38_49" id="Footnote_38_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_49"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Page 20.&mdash;Six volumes of Dr. Kingsford's "History of Canada" have appeared
since 1887. Volume i. embraces the period from 1608 to 1682; vol. ii., 1679&ndash;1725; vol.
iii., 1726&ndash;1756; vol. iv., 1756&ndash;1763; vol. v., 1763&ndash;1775; vol. vi., 1776&ndash;1779. Toronto and
London, 8vo. For bibliographical notes on various works relating to the political and
general history of Canada see Bourinot's "Parliamentary Government in Canada,"
'Am. Hist. Ass. Papers,' 1891, App. References are there made to McMullen, Withrow,
Murdoch, Campbell, Hincks, etc. Also 'Nar. and Crit. Hist. Am.,' viii., 171&ndash;189.
As usual, the learned editor, Dr. Winsor, supplies by his notes many deficiencies in
the text. Also, Edmond Lareau's "Histoire de la Litt&#233;rature Canadienne" (Montreal),
c. 4, and Mr. J. C. Dent's "Last Forty Years; or, Canada since the Union of
1841," c. 42, on "Literature and Journalism." Among the later French Canadian
writers who are doing excellent historical work is Dr. N. E. Dionne, F.R.S.C.,
author of several books on Cartier and his successors and Champlain. Mr. Hannay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of St. John has written a "History of Acadia," which has been well received (St.
John, N.B., 1879, 8vo.) The Abb&#233; Auguste Gosselin is another industrious French
Canadian writer. Mr. Joseph Tass&#233;, whose "Canadiens de l'Ouest" (Montreal, 1878,
two volumes) was distinguished by much research and literary skill, has of late years
devoted himself mainly to politics and journalism, though he has found time to write
several essays for the 'Trans. Roy. Soc. Can.,' and a small volume, "38<sup>me</sup> Fauteuil,
ou Souvenirs Parlementaires" (Montreal, 1891), a series of political sketches, written
in excellent French. A monumental work is the "Dictionnaire G&#233;n&#233;alogique des
familles canadiennes" by Mgr. Tanguay, F.R.S.C., invaluable to students of French
Canadian history and ethnography.</p>

illustrations of French poetic art yet produced in the Dominion; and one who reads
them can easily understand that "Les Fleurs Bor&#233;ales" and "Les Oiseaux de
Neige" (now in the third edition, Montreal) should have been crowned by the French
Academy in 1880, and that he should have been accorded the Monthyon prize as a
matter of course. His other volumes of poems are these: "Mes Loisirs," Quebec,
1863; "La Voix d'un Exil&#233;," Quebec, 1869; "P&#234;le-M&#234;le," Montreal, 1877; "Les
Oubli&#233;s" and "Voix d'Outre-Mer," Montreal, 1886; and "Feuilles Volantes," Montreal,
1891. His poem on the discovery of the Mississippi is probably his best sustained
effort on the whole. A number of his poems have appeared in the 'Trans. Roy. Soc.
Can.,' vols. i., ii., iii., iv. He has published some dramas and comedies (see 'Am.
Cyclop&#230;dia of Biography,' vol. ii., p. 539), which have not been as successful as his
purely poetic essays. He has also written several essays of merit in 'Harper's
Monthly' and other periodicals of the day, as well as in the 'Trans. Roy. Soc. Can.'</p>

<p>Mr. Pamphile LeMay, one of the best known French Canadian poets, has published
the following: "Essais Po&#233;tiques," Quebec, 1865; "La D&#233;couverte du Canada,"
Quebec, 1867; "Po&#232;mes Couronn&#233;s," Quebec, 1870; "Les Vengeances," Quebec,
1875, 1876 and 1888 (also dramatized); "Une Gerbe," Quebec, 1879. He has also
written "Fables Canadiennes," Quebec, 1882. A number of his poems have appeared
in the 'Trans. Roy. Soc. Can.,' vols i., iii., v., vi., ix. He has also written several
stories of Canadian life: "L'Affaire Sougraine," Quebec, 1884; "Le P&#232;lerin de Sainte-Anne,"
new ed., Montreal, 1893; and "Rouge et Bleu," comedy. One of his best
works was a translation of Longfellow's "Evangeline."</p>

<p>The following is a list of other Canadian books of poems, of varying merit, which
have appeared within a quarter of a century:</p>

<p>"The Songs of a Wanderer." By Carroll Ryan. Ottawa, 1867. Indicated much
poetic taste, but the poet has been submerged in the busy journalist.</p>

<p>"Songs of Life." By Rev. E. H. Dewart. Toronto, 1867. He was author of the
first collection of Canadian poems made in this country. See <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>"The Prophecy of Merlin and other Poems." By John Reade. Montreal, 1870.
In many respects the best sustained poems written by a Canadian can be read in
this book.</p>

<p>"Les Laurentiennes." By Benjamin Sulte. Montreal, 1870.</p>

<p>"Les Chants Nouveaux." By the same. Ottawa, 1880.</p>

<p>"The Legend of the Rose." By Samuel J. Watson. Toronto, 1876. Mr. Watson
was a writer of promise who died in the maturity of his power.</p>

<p>"The Feast of St. Anne, and other Poems." By P. S. Hamilton. Montreal,
1878; 2nd ed. 1890. Has some interest from its description of the ceremonies at the
feast of Sainte-Anne du Canada&mdash;the tutelary saint of the Canadian aborigines&mdash;which
is held by the Micmacs on the 26th day of July in each year on Chapel Island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
in the beautiful Bras d'Or Lake of Cape Breton. See Bourinot's "Cape Breton."</p>

<p>"Waifs in Verse." (Ottawa, ed. in 1878, 1887 and 1891.) By G. W. Wicksteed,
Q.C., for fifty years the able law clerk of the Canadian Commons.</p>

<p>"A Collection of Poems." By Miss Williams of Grenville, P.Q., 1879.</p>

<p>"The Coming of the Princess, and Other Poems." By Kate Seymour Maclean of
Kingston. 1880.</p>

<p>"Lyrics, Songs and Sonnets." By A. H. Chandler and C. Pelham Mulvany.
Toronto, 1880.</p>

<p>"The Times, and Other Poems." By J. R. Newell of Woodstock. 1880.</p>

<p>"The Consolation." By George Gerrard. Montreal, 1880.</p>

<p>"Poems of the Heart and Home." By Mrs. J. C. Yule. Toronto, 1880.</p>

<p>"Poems, Songs and Odes." By Archibald McAlpine Taylor. Toronto, 1881.</p>

<p>"The New Song, and Other Poems." By Mrs. W. H. Clarke. Toronto, 1883.</p>

<p>"Zenobia. A Poem in Rhymed Heroics." By Rev. &#198;. McD. Dawson, F.R.S.C.
1883.</p>

<p>"The Mission of Love, and Other Poems." By Caris Sima. 1883.</p>

<p>"Lorenzo, and Other Poems." By J. R. Pollock of Keswick, Ont. 1883.</p>

<p>"Caprices Po&#233;tiques et Chansons Satiriques." Par R&#233;mi Tremblay.
Montr&#233;al, 1883.</p>

<p>"Les Echos." Par J. B. Routhier. Qu&#233;bec, 1883, 12mo. Judge Routhier is a
member of the Royal Society of Canada, in whose 'Trans.' (vol. iv., Sec. I.) appeared
"Lettre d'un Volontaire du 9<sup>ieme</sup> Voltigeurs camp&#233; &#224; Calgary." His literary reputation
stands high among his countrymen.</p>

<p>"Old Spookse's Pass, and Other Poems." By Isabella Valancy Crawford. Toronto,
1884.</p>

<p>"Marguerite, and Other Poems." By George Martin. 1886.</p>

<p>"Laura Secord: a Ballad of 1812." By Mrs. Curzon. Toronto, 1886.</p>

<p>"Songs, Sonnets and Miscellaneous Poems." By J. Imrie. Toronto, 1886.</p>

<p>"Dreamland, and Other Poems" (Ottawa, 1868), and "Tecumseh: a Drama"
(Toronto and London, 1886). By Charles Mair, a poet of original talent, and descriptive
power, who is now a resident of the North-west Territories.</p>

<p>"Orion, and Other Poems" (Philadelphia, 1880), and "In Divers Tones" (Montreal,
1887). By Prof. C. G. D. Roberts, who is the best known abroad of all Canadian
poets, and represents that Canadian or national spirit which has been slowly rising
from the birth of Confederation. Since the days of Cr&#233;mazie&mdash;over thirty years ago&mdash;there
are other poets who recognize the existence of a Canadian people in a large
sense&mdash;a Canadian people of two races, born and educated in the country, and having
common aspirations for a united, not an isolated, future. Prof. Roberts is now
bringing out a new volume of poems in London.</p>

<p>The poetic taste of the Archbishop of Halifax, the Most Rev. C. O'Brien, F.R.S.C.,
is well illustrated in the following volume: "Aminta: a Modern Life Drama," New
York, 1890. The Archbishop is also the author of a novel, "After Weary Years,"
(Baltimore and New York, 1885), the scenes of which are laid in Rome and Canada,
and are described with much power of invention and fervour. As the author himself
says, "historic places and events are accurately described." He has, it will be seen
from his preface, great confidence in the future national greatness of the Dominion.</p>

<p>"A Gate of Flowers." By T. O'Hagan. Toronto, 1887. He has another volume
in press.</p>

<p>"The Masque of Minstrels, and Other Pieces, chiefly in verse." By B. W. and
A. J. Lockhart. Bangor, Me., 1887. These two brothers are Nova Scotians by birth
and education, who lived their youth in the land of Evangeline. The Gasp&#233;reaux and
Grand Pr&#233; are naturally the constant theme of their pleasing verse.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>"Among the Millet, and Other Poems." By Archibald Lampman. Ottawa,
1888. Some of Mr. Lampman's most finished sonnets have appeared in the best
American periodicals, to which he is still a frequent contributor; his work shows
the true poetic instinct. He holds a position in the Civil Service at Ottawa.</p>

<p>"The Water Lily. An Oriental Fairy Tale." By Frank Waters. Ottawa, 1888.</p>

<p>"De Roberval: a Drama. Also the Emigration of the Fairies, and the Triumph
of Constancy: a Romaunt." By John Hunter Duvar. St. John, N.B., 1888. Mr.
Duvar, who has fine literary tastes, has been a resident of Prince Edward Island
for some years.</p>

<p>"The Epic of the Dawn, and Other Poems." By Nicholas Flood Davin. Regina,
N.W.T., 1889. Mr. Davin is the clever "Irishman in Canada," and while the most
pretentious of his poems in this little book were written across the ocean, others are
the product of Canadian thought and sentiment.</p>

<p>"Lake Lyrics, and Other Poems." By W. Wilfred Campbell. St. John, N.B.,
1889. Mr. Campbell, who was originally a clergyman of the Church of England, is
now in the public service at Ottawa, and has written some of his best poems for
American magazines. One on "The Mother," in 'Harper's Monthly' is full of poetic
thought and deep pathos, and should be better known by Canadians than it appears
to be. At this time of writing his new volume of poems entitled "The Dread Voyage"
(Toronto, 1893), has appeared; it sustains his reputation, though one can hardly encourage
his effort to imitate Tennyson in such poems as "Sir Lancelot." Canadian
poets too frequently are imitative rather than original. Mr. Campbell's verses on
the varied scenery of the lakes of the West show the artistic temperament.</p>

<p>"Pine, Rose and Fleur-de-Lis." By S. Frances Harrison ("Seranus"). Toronto,
1891.</p>

<p>"Songs, Lyrical and Dramatic." By John Henry Brown. Ottawa, 1892, 12mo.
The New York 'Nation' truly says of this new poetic aspirant that he has Walt
Whitman's tendencies, but nevertheless he "writes in a generous spirit, and may
yet have thoughts and expression all his own." The fact is, I repeat, most Canadian
poets are too imitative and too rarely original.</p>

<p>"Tendres Choses. Po&#233;sies Canadiennes." By Dr. R. Chevrier. Montreal, 1892,
12mo. That an author unknown to fame should give us his portrait, as in this case,
is perplexing. Still the verse is frequently melodious, though it represents what is
a feature of French poetry, melodious rhythm, rather than strength and thought.</p>

<p>"This Canada of Ours, and Other Poems." By J. D. Edgar, M.P., Toronto, 1893.
This little volume contains "The White Stone Canoe: a Legend of the Ottawas,"
which had been published in separate form some years previously. His French and
Latin translations are full of taste.</p>

<p>"Les Perce-Neige, premi&#232;res po&#233;sies." By Napol&#233;on Legendre. Montreal, 12mo.
He is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, and constant contributor (generally
in prose) to its 'Transactions.'</p>

<p>"Mes Rimes." By Elz&#233;ar Labelle. Montreal, 1886, 8vo.</p>

<p>Selections of Canadian poems have appeared of recent years in the following publications:</p>

<p>1. "Selections from Canadian Poets: with occasional critical and biographical
notes and an introductory essay on Canadian poetry." By the Rev. E. H. Dewart.
Montreal, 1864, 8vo.</p>

<p>2. "Songs of the Great Dominion: Voices from the Forests and Waters, the
Settlements and Cities of Canada." Selected and edited by W. D. Lighthall, M.A.,
of Montreal. London, 1889, 12mo.</p>

<p>4. "Later Canadian Poems." Edited by J. E. Wetherell, B.A. Toronto, 1893.</p>

<p>In the first mentioned work, which is judiciously edited, the poets until 1864
obtain a place. In the three other books we have selections from John Reade, Geo.

B. Sulte, P. LeMay, and others. I enumerate these names to show how many Canadians
have ventured upon the field of poesy despite the practical realities of life in
this relatively new country. The selections in the second of these works would
have been more valuable had they contained "Our Fathers" by Joseph Howe&mdash;the
most spirited poem in some respects ever written by a native Canadian. To the
names of poetic aspirants, too, must be added those of M. J. Katzmann and of M. J.
Griffin, whose fugitive pieces have attracted notice. Mr. Griffin has fine literary
tastes and his few poems, only the relaxation of leisure hours, show he might win
fame in this delightful department of letters. The reader will obtain some idea
of the standard of Canadian poetry by reading the selections, and should not be carried
away by the too obvious enthusiasm that has at times stifled the critical
faculty in the editors. The poetic genius of Canadians is to be stimulated, not by
sentimental gush, but by a judicious criticism that is not sufficiently cultivated by
our writers who review the efforts of our poets, historians and essayists. These
remarks also apply to such articles as that by the late Mr. Lesp&#233;rance on "The
Poets of Canada" in 'Trans. Roy. Soc. Can.,' vol. ii., Sec. II.</p>

<p>Mr. Evan McColl, F.R.S.C., is the Gaelic poet of Canada. Three editions have
appeared of the "Cl&#224;rsach nam Beann," which was printed as far back as 1838 in
Glasgow. The same was also published in English in the same year, under the
title of "The Mountain Minstrel," of which six editions have been printed. In 1883
he published in Toronto "Poems and Songs chiefly written in Canada." Mr. McColl
is a great favourite among his Scotch countrymen everywhere; but his decidedly
original poetic genius, rude and wild as it is at times, is not a Canadian product, for
he was born at Kenmore, Lochfyne-Side, Scotland, in 1808, and it was not until he
was forty years of age that he made Canada his home. He is now a resident of
Toronto, and still comes to the annual meetings of the Royal Society, of which he
was one of the original members.</p>

<p class="center p1t">LAURA SECORD'S WARNING.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_41A_53" id="Footnote_41A_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41A_53"><span class="label">[41<i>a</i>]</span></a> Page 24.&mdash;In Mrs. Edgar's excellent annotations to the Ridout Letters in
"Ten Years of Upper Canada in Peace and War, 1805&ndash;1815," (Toronto, 1890), appears
the following account of a courageous woman's exploit which brought disaster to
the Americans soon after their defeat at Stoney Creek:</p>

<p>"At a place called Beaver Dams, or Beechwoods, (about twelve miles in a direct
road from Queenstown), where is now the town of Thorold, was a depot for provisions
for the Canadian troops, guarded by a detachment of thirty of the 49th regiment
under Lieutenant Fitzgibbon with some Indians and militia, in all about 200
men. In order to surprise and dislodge this outpost, an American force of 500 men,
with fifty cavalry and two field-pieces, under Colonel Boerstler, set out from Fort
George (Niagara) on the 23rd of June [1813]. A surprise was meditated, in retaliation,
no doubt, for the affair of Stoney Creek. Laura Secord, wife of a Canadian farmer,
who had been wounded in the battle of Queenstown Heights, accidentally heard of
the designs of the Americans, and determined to give the outpost timely warning.
She set out alone before day-break, on the 23rd June, from her house at Queenstown,
and arrived at Fitzgibbon's headquarters, a stone house known as DeCew's, near the
Beaver Dams, at sunset of the same day. On account of the American sentries and
outposts, she had to avoid the high roads and beaten paths, thus making her toilsome
journey nearly twice as long. In spite of weakness and fatigue, this heroic
woman went on her way through pathless woods, over hill and dale and unbridged
streams, till she reached her destination. Her warning came just in time. Lieutenant
Fitzgibbon disposed of his little force to the best advantage possible, placing
them in ambush on both sides of the road, and taking every precaution to make it
appear that he had a large force in reserve. Between eight and nine in the morning
of the 24th June, the advance guard of the American riflemen appeared. A volley
from the woods received them and emptied their saddles. Soon firing came from all
directions, and bugle calls, and Indian yells. The bewildered Americans imagined
themselves in the presence of a much superior force. Finding that his men were
losing heavily from the fire of the unseen foe, and that they were suffering from
fatigue and heat, he consented to surrender. By the capitulation 542 men, 2 field-pieces,
some ammunition waggons, and the colours of the 14th U.S. regiment were
delivered over to the Canadians. For this brilliant achievement Lieutenant Fitzgibbon
[afterwards a military knight of Windsor] received his Company and a Captain's
commission. As to Laura Secord, her reward has come to her in fame. The
heroine lived until the year 1868, and sleeps now in that old cemetery at Drummondville,
where lie so many of our brave soldiers. There is no 'Decoration Day' in
Canada, but if there were, surely this woman is entitled to the laurel wreath."

<p class="center p1t">AUSTRALIAN POETS AND NOVELISTS.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_42_54" id="Footnote_42_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_54"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Page 25.&mdash;The Canadian reader can profitably and easily compare his own
poets with those of Australia by reading Slade's "Australian Poets, 1788&ndash;1883, being
a selection of poems upon all subjects written in Australia and New Zealand during
the first century of the British colonization, with brief notes on their authors, etc."
(London and Sydney, 1889.) It will be seen, however, that nearly all the so-called
"Australian" poets are English born, while with one or two exceptions, those of
Canada best known to fame are the product of Canadian life and thought. Henry
Clarence Kendall, "the poet of New South Wales," was born at Ulladulla, on the
coast of that colony, in 1842. He is the one Australian poet of reputation, except his
forerunner, Charles Harpur, who was actually born under the Southern Cross.
Kendall's verses on "Coogee," a striking natural feature of Australian scenery,
show true poetic instinct and rhythmical ease:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Sing the song of wave-worn Coogee-Coogee in the distance white,</div>
  <div class="i0">With its jags and points disrupted, gaps and fractures fringed with light;</div>
  <div class="i0">Haunt of gledes and restless plovers of the melancholy wail,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ever lending deeper pathos to the melancholy gale.</div>
  <div class="i0">There, my brothers, down the fissures, chasms deep and wan and wild,</div>
  <div class="i0">Grows the sea-bloom, one that blushes like a shrinking, fair, blind child,</div>
  <div class="i0">And amongst the oozing forelands many a glad green rockvine runs,</div>
  <div class="i0">Getting ease on earthy ledges sheltered from December suns."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But among the many spirited poems written in Australia since its settlement
not one can equal the "Sick Stock-rider," by Adam Lindsay Gordon, who came to
South Australia in his early manhood, and attempted sheep-farming, with the
result of "owning nothing but a love for horsemanship and a head full of Browning
and Shelley." This is a quotation from an introduction to his book by Marcus
Clarke, himself a novelist and poet. One can see in the mind's eye the scenes described
in the following verses, so full of real life and genuine poetry:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"'Twas merry in the glowing morn, among the gleaming grass,</div>
  <div class="i2">To wander as we've wandered many a mile,</div>
  <div class="i0">And blow the cool tobacco cloud and watch the white wreaths pass,</div>
  <div class="i2">Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas merry 'mid the backwoods, when we spied the station roofs,</div>
  <div class="i2">To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a running fire of stockwhips and a fiery run of hoofs.</div>
  <div class="i2">Oh! the hardest day was never then too hard!</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Aye! we had a glorious gallop after 'Starlight' and his gang,</div>
  <div class="i2">When they bolted from Sylvester's on the flat;</div>
  <div class="i0">How the sun-dried reed-beds crackled, how the flint-strewn ranges rang</div>
  <div class="i2">To the strokes of 'Mountaineer' and 'Acrobat';</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard behind them in the timber, harder still across the heath,</div>
  <div class="i2">Close behind them through the tea-tree scrub we dashed;</div>
  <div class="i0">And the golden-tinted fern-leaves, how they rustled underneath!</div>
  <div class="i2">And the honeysuckle osiers, how they crash'd!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The best known novels of Australian life are these: "For the Term of His Natural
Life," by Marcus Clarke, who was an Englishman born and educated; "The Miner's
Right," "The Squatter's Dream," "A Colonial Reformer," and "Robbery Under
Arms," by Thomas A. Browne ("Rolf Boldrewood"), who was also English born:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
"Uncle Piper of Piper's Hill," by Madame Couvreur ("Tasma"), who is of Belgian
descent, and is now a resident of Belgium, though she was born in Australia and
there studied its social conditions; "The Australian Girl" and "A Silent Sea," by
Mrs. Alick McLeod. Mrs. Campbell Praed, who is colonial born, has, in addition
to several novels, written "Australian Life," which is described by Sir Charles Dilke
("Problems of Greater Britain," i., 374) as "a vivid autobiographical picture of the
early days of Queensland." Copies of these and other Australian books the writer
owes to the thoughtfulness of Chief Justice Way, D.C.L., Oxon., of Adelaide, South
Australia. For many years he has been the recipient of these graceful attentions
from friends in that fair land of the Southern Cross, and though it looks very much
as if he will never meet some of them face to face&mdash;for the time is passing rapidly
with us all&mdash;he takes this opportunity of now sending them his thanks across the
seas.</p>

Canadian periodicals which have appeared for the last thirty years, and after a
short career died for want of adequate support. In the numerous periodicals of
England and the United States English Canadian writers have great advantages

<p><a name="Footnote_50_63" id="Footnote_50_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_63"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Page 29.&mdash;James De Mille was a native of New Brunswick, and a professor
in Dalhousie College, N. S., at the time of his death. His first work of fiction was
"Helena's Household: a Tale of Rome in the First Century" (New York, 1858). His
most popular works, "The Dodge Club Abroad" (1866), "Cord and Creese" (1867),
"The Cryptogram" (1871), and "A Castle in Spain" (1883), first appeared in 'Harper's
Monthly.' A strange, imaginative work, "A Curious MS. Found in a Copper Cylinder,"
was published in New York in 1888, and is understood to have been written by
him. It was not until Rider Haggard's fiction became popular that the New York
publishers ventured to print a book which so severely taxes the credulity of the
reader. As a work of pure invention it is in some respects superior to those of the
English author. Mr. De Mille died in 1880, at the age of 43, when much was expected
of him. See Appleton's "Cyclo. Am. Biogr.," ii., 138, for a list of his published works
except the one just mentioned.</p>

Miss Duncan, in company with another young lady, in 1889&ndash;90, went around the
world, and made numerous contributions to the press of Canada during that tour,
but its noteworthy result is the first mentioned volume. She is now married and a
resident of India, whose striking aspects of social life she is studying and portraying
in print. Her latest story, or rather sketch, of Indian customs, "The Simple Adventures
of a Memsahib" (New York, 1893), has many touches of quiet humour. One
must regret that her talent has not been directed to the incidents of Canadian life.</p>

your honorary president, to ask the sympathy and encouragement which the governor-general,
as Her Majesty's representative, might rightly be asked to manifest towards
the representatives of science and of the liberal arts. I am afraid that my contributions
to literature and science have been few. I do not know they are such as
would have merited the notice of the Royal Society, but I can assure you that none
of the members of your body take a deeper interest in all that concerns the welfare
of your Society than he who is now laying down the office of honorary president.
(Cheers.) There were some persons who considered that in a comparatively new
country like Canada it was ambitious on her part when the foundations of the Royal
Society were laid, but there must be a beginning of all things, and I think I may
appeal to the work which has been and is being done by the different branches of
the Society as evidence that its establishment was in no sense premature, but that
it was fittingly determined that the progress of science and literature should take
place coincidently with that of the country. In a new country like this&mdash;I think
you have touched upon it in your address&mdash;there is a great tendency to further
one's material wants, to promote trade and commerce, and to put aside, as it were,
literature and the sciences; but here the Royal Society has stepped in and done
good work by uniting those who were scattered by distance and who find in the
meetings of our Society a convenient opportunity of coming together for the exchanging
of ideas and renewing of those friendships which, though perhaps only yearly
meetings permit, are nevertheless enduring. If we look back we shall best see what
good work is being done. If we could imagine the existence of such a society as this
in the older countries in olden times, what a mine of wealth of information would
have been afforded us! We see that from the very first, whether in literature, which
forms so important a part in our Society; whether it be in the constitutional studies,
in which our President is such an adept&mdash;and I was glad to see his authority has
been quoted on the other side of the Atlantic as well as on this&mdash;whether it be in the
literature of the chivalrous pioneers of France, who first led the way into the unbroken
wilderness, or whether it be in the latter days of constitutional progress of
this country and its relations both to the old world and the country growing up
alongside of us.</p>

<p>In literature, history and poetry, also, the Society will from the first have its
stamp, as we trust, upon the future of the Canadian race. (Cheers.) That science
and the arts to an equal extent may find a place here is our earnest wish, in order
that by sentiment and feeling we may bind together in the closest ties that by which
she must achieve a great and enduring success. I must not detain you from your
other duties, but I could not refrain from saying in a few words how heartily and
truly I appreciate and believe in the work of the Royal Society. At your next meeting,
as you truly say, I fear I shall not be amongst you; but though the Atlantic may
roll between us, you may be certain that in spirit, at least, I hope to be present at
your meeting, and shall follow with the liveliest and deepest interest any record you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
may be good enough to send me of what takes place on that occasion. * * * * *
I appeal not the less to my French colleagues than to my English ones in all matters
which relate to the welfare of the Society. Science, art and literature, it is true, are
cosmopolitan, but they are well knit together in this Society. We who have experienced
in Canada the hospitality of its people are grateful for it. We have admired
the greatness of the resources of this country, and we look forward to a society like
this as having ample work to do in the future. As in every respect Canada seems to
be disposed always to take a forward part, so I hope the Royal Society will ever
press on to a higher and higher goal; and, gentlemen, I can wish to the Royal
Society, to all my friends and brothers of the Society, to whom I once more tender
my hearty thanks, no greater blessing than, like Canada itself, that they may be
happy, united and prosperous. (Loud and prolonged cheers.)</p>

other day invited us to take part in a symposium the subject of which was 'How
to Produce a Perfect Man.' The problem was large, but one help to its solution
might have been a reminder to keep the balance. A romantic age stands in need of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
science, a scientific and utilitarian age stands in need of the humanities. Darwin
avows that poetry gave him no pleasure whatever. This surely was a loss, unless
the whole side of things which poetry denotes is dead and gone, nothing but dry
science being left us; in which case the generations that are coming may have some
reason, with all their increase of knowledge and power, to wish that they had lived
nearer the youth of the world." See <i>supra</i>, Note 1, for Mr. Lowell's remarks on the

<p><a name="Footnote_64_78" id="Footnote_64_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_78"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Page 54.&mdash;An Art Society was founded in Upper Canada as far back as 1841,
but its exhibitions were necessarily representative of British works of art. The
present Art Association was founded in Montreal in 1860, and the Ontario School of
Arts, which is doing excellent work, twelve years later, with its headquarters in
Toronto. The Royal Canadian Academy, mentioned in the text, was established in
1880. The influence of these and two or three minor institutions in Canada has been
on the whole in the direction of stimulating art, but their efforts are not adequately
encouraged by government or people in the provinces.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the painters in oils and water colours whose pictures
now make the principal features of the annual exhibitions in Ontario and Quebec,
and the majority of whom were inadequately represented at Chicago: F. A. Verner,
whose Indian and Canadian scenes are excellent; H. M. Matthews, who has made a
high reputation for his Rocky Mountain paintings; L. R. O'Brien, essentially the
most finished painter of picturesque Canada; T. Mower Martin, an industrious
painter of wild sports and Canadian scenery; E. Wyley Grier, who has done some
good work in portraits and natural scenery; W. Brymner, one of the most promising
younger painters of Canadian scenes: George Reid, whose "Foreclosure of the
Mortgage" is one of the best pictures produced in the Dominion; John Hammond
of St. John, N.B., a painter of water life; Percy Woodcock, whose efforts at sketches
of Canadian rural life are praiseworthy: F. M. Bell-Smith, who has a decided artistic
faculty for the portraiture of our noblest scenery; Homer Watson, a favourite for his
rustic landscapes and romantic pastorals; J. W. L. Forster, in some respects the best
figure painter, but also capable of good landscapes; G. Bruenech, a careful artist of
scenery; Ernest Thompson, who has made some good efforts at prairie subjects;
J. C. Forbes, who painted Mr. Gladstone's portrait, and is one of the best artists of
the class that Canada has so far known; W. Raphael and O. R. Jacobi, two of the
oldest and best known painters of Canadian landscape. To these we must add Miss
Minnie A. Bell, A. Watson, Miss Sidney S. Tully, Mrs. M. H. Reid, J. T. Rolph,
R. F. Gagen, T. C. McGillivray Knowles, Forshaw Day, L. Huot, Mlle. Colombier,
E. Dyonnet, C. Macdonald Manly, D. P. MacKillsan, J. W. Morrice, A. D. Patterson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Miss G. F. Spurr, F. S. Challener, Paul J. Wickson, Mrs. M. B. Screiber, W. Revell,
D. Fowler, Miss E. May Martin, Miss Laura Muntz, Miss F. M. Bell-Smith, Miss
Florence Carlyle, Miss I. M. F. Adams, Owen P. Staples, Mrs. M. E. Dignam, Charles
Alexander, W. E. Atkinson, J. C. Mills, J. A. Fraser (in New York), Carl Ahrens,
W. A. Sherwood, Miss Fannie Sutherland, T. C. V. Ede, H. Sandham (in New York),
Mr. Harvey, Mr. Cruickshank, Mr. Seavey, A. Cox, Miss Edwards, J. Griffith, Colin
Scott, J. Wilson, James Smith, C. J. Way, F. Brownell, A. P. Coleman, R. Harris,
Miss Holden and Miss Houghton. Many of these artists, whose merits, of course,
vary much, are not native Canadians. One of the strongest landscape painters,
Mr. Matthews, is an Englishman, who has now, after some years, thoroughly understood
the light and colour of Canadian scenery. O'Brien, Brymner, L. Huot, Forbes,
Forster, Pinhey, Sidney Tully, G. Harris, Gagen, Knowles, Watson, Alexander,
A. D. Patterson, C. M. Manly, E. May Martin and George Reid are Canadians.
G. T. Berthon, who died recently in Toronto at an advanced age, and was known as
a painter of numerous portraits, the best of which are to be seen in Osgoode Hall,
was of French origin and education. Raphael is German by birth and education.
Jacobi is a painter of the Dusseldorf school, and was at one time employed in the court
of the King of Bavaria. Bruenech is a native, I understand, of Denmark, though
educated in Canada. E. W. Grier is an Englishman by birth and education, with a
knowledge of French art derived from study in Paris. So is Ernest Thompson, who
also studied in Paris. Mower Martin is an Englishman, educated in that country
and in Canada, with whose scenery he has been always enamoured. Carl Ahrens
was born and educated in the United States. Miss Minnie Bell and Miss Laura
Muntz are among the most promising younger artists of Canada. Both were born
and received their elementary education in Canada. Miss Bell, after studying in
Paris, is now in Montreal. Miss Muntz is still studying in Paris. Robert Harris is
a native of Prince Edward Island. Mr. N. Bourassa, who is a French Canadian
artist, has of late years devoted himself to ecclesiastical decoration. His best work
is to be seen in the architecture and decoration of the churches of Notre Dame de
Nazareth and Notre Dame de Lourdes, in Montreal, and he has the credit of having
first applied probably in America "the art of painting to the adornment of Christian
churches in the broad and thorough manner so common at one period in central
Italy." (See Dr. S. E. Dawson's "Handbook of Canada," Montreal, 1888, pp. 183,
184.) The influence of the French schools of painting can be seen in the best works
of Paul Peel (now dead), Forster, Harris, Geo. Reid and John Pinhey (born at Ottawa),
all of whom have had success at the salons. At the present time there are some
twenty-five Canadians, more or less, studying in Paris, and the majority are French
Canadians. In fact, the French schools draw students from Canada as well as from
the United States, and England is relatively ignored. The artistic temperament is
more stimulated by the <i>ateliers</i> and the student life of Paris than among the more
business-like and cold surroundings of a student in London. In sculpture the names
are very few, Hamilton McCarthy, H&#233;bert and Dunbar having alone done meritorious
work, but of these three H&#233;bert is the only native Canadian. One of the very
first painters to draw attention, years ago, to Canadian scenery, especially to the
wonderfully vivid tints of autumn, was Krieghoff, whose pictures have been so much
copied that it is difficult now to tell the originals from the reproductions. He was,
however, not a native Canadian but a Swiss painter from the German-speaking cantons,
I believe. The name of Paul Kane (born in Toronto) will be always identified
with Indian life and customs, and as the pioneer of art in Canada. A fine collection
of his paintings is in the possession of Hon. G. W. Allan, who has always taken an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
active interest in the development of art in the city of which he has been so long an
honoured citizen.</p>

<p>Among other Canadian artists who laboured in the commencement of art studies
in this country may be mentioned the following: Dulongpr&#233;, Samuel Berczy, Audy,
William Berczy, Vincent Zacharie Thelariolin (Indian of Lorette, 1812&ndash;1886), Hamel,
Carey, T. H. Burnett, J. J. Girouard, P. Leber&mdash;many of whose artistic efforts are
already forgotten though their work was meritorious. With respect to Berthon,
the following note by Col. G. T. Denison, F.R.S.C., of Toronto, which I have received
since writing of the artist above, will be of interest: "His father was a court painter
under the great Napoleon, and several of his pictures are now in Versailles. He
was a Frenchman, and I think was in Vienna when his son, my old friend, was
born; for I am under the impression Berthon told me he was born in Vienna. I
think he was brought up in France, and went to London when comparatively young,
and there set up as a portrait painter. He was induced to come out to Canada about
the year 1843 or 1844, and settled in Toronto soon after, where he died about a year
ago, over eighty years of age. He was certainly, when in his prime, the best portrait
painter we ever had in Canada, and in my opinion was better than most of the men
of great celebrity in London to-day."</p>

<p>The successful artists at the World's Fair, where 113 works in all were presented
from Canada, were the following: Mr. G. Reid, whose great picture mentioned above
could not fail to attract much notice, Mr. Harris, Mr. Ede, Miss Holden and Mr.
J. A. Fraser. This is satisfactory in view of the fact that the best work of the majority
of leading Canadian artists was not represented in the exhibition. Apart
from Mr. Reid's painting, the pictures that were signalled out for special notice
were not equal in some respects to other efforts of the same artists that have been
seen in our annual exhibitions.</p>

<p>In closing this note I cannot do better than give the following judicious remarks
on art in Canada, delivered before the Canadian Institute, by an able Canadian artist,
J. W. L. Forster: "The art of Canada to-day is a mingling of elements.... The
influence of the old world may be seen in the work of many who cherish still the
precepts of their masters. Yet it is due to those who have adopted Canada as their
home to say they are as Canadian in the faithful reproduction of the pure glories of
our climate as those who first saw the sun in our own sky. Our native artists who
have studied abroad are much inclined to paint a Canadian sky with the haze of
Western Europe, and our verdure, too, as though it grew upon foreign soil. Our art
is not Canadian.... Material is certainly not wanting, nor <i>motif</i> of the
grander order. The first requisite is for a stronger national spirit. Events are
slowly developing this; and the signs are full of promise in this direction. The
second great need is for a museum equipped with well-chosen specimens of the
world's art. Our government and citizens are establishing schools of industrial and
fine art, yet when we would point our pupils to examples of pure art, lo! there are
none; and when we would know what art has been, in order to discover what art
may be, we must go as exiles and pilgrims to foreign cities. A museum that gives
the best of their art history and achievement will greatly strengthen our hope and
give rein to our ambition. A third need is for capable and generous criticism.
There are many men whose discernment and sympathies fit them eminently for the
role of art critic; but as yet journalism has not opened wide the door to advancement
in such a specialty."</p>

<p class="center p1t">ARCHITECTURAL ART.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_64A_79" id="Footnote_64A_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64A_79"><span class="label">[64<i>a</i>]</span></a> Page 57.&mdash;While Canadian architecture is generally wanting in originality
of conception, yet it affords many good illustrations of the effective adaptation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the best art of Europe to the principal edifices of the large cities. These are the
most noteworthy public buildings:</p>

<p>In <i>Ottawa</i>.&mdash;The parliament and departmental buildings, admirable examples of
Italian Gothic of the 13th century, with a fine central tower, the effect of which has
been marred by a later tower in the western block out of harmony with the general
design of an otherwise perfect group.</p>

<p>In <i>Quebec</i>.&mdash;The legislative building in the French style of the 17th century, noteworthy
for its niches containing statues of men famous in French Canadian history.</p>

<p>In <i>Montreal</i>.&mdash;The parish church of Notre Dame, on the Place d'Armes, of a
simple Gothic style, attractive for its stateliness and massiveness.</p>

<p>Christ Church Cathedral, on St. Catherine street, worthy of study as an admirable
specimen of the early English style of ecclesiastical architecture, exhibiting
unity of design and correctness of proportions.</p>

<p>Notre Dame de Lourdes, whose interior has been already spoken of (see preceding
note); a good example of the Byzantine order, combined with effects of the Italian
Renaissance recalling Venetian architecture.</p>

<p>The Montreal Bank, on St. James street, an artistic illustration of the Corinthian
order, with an interior interesting for the artistic effort to illustrate on the walls
remarkable scenes in Canadian history.</p>

<p>The Canadian Pacific Station, on Windsor street, a fine example of an adaptation
of old Norman architecture to modern necessities.</p>

<p>In <i>Toronto</i>.&mdash;The University, perhaps the best example in America of a modern
conception of Norman architecture, with a tower of much beauty.</p>

<p>Trinity University, whose graceful Tudor-Gothic design, in which the tower is a
conspicuous feature, is marred by the clumsy projection of a later chapel building,
entirely out of harmony with the admirable front.</p>

<p>Osgoode Hall, of the Ionic order, modified by additions of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>St. Andrew's Church, a combination of the Norman and Byzantine orders, more
suitable for a great library or a hall than an ecclesiastical edifice. As a specimen of
architecture, apart from its purpose, it is harmonious and artistic.</p>

<p>The new legislative buildings, which are the most pretentious in Canada after
the Ottawa parliament house, are a praiseworthy effort to illustrate the Romanesque,
with details of the Celtic and Indo-Germanic schools.</p>

<p>The Methodist Metropolitan Church, a judicious example of a modern form of
the Gothic style which distinguished the 13th century in France. It is at once
simple and harmonious in its general design, and has a massive tower which adds to
the general effect of the whole structure.</p>

<p>St. James's Church, often cited as a good example of ecclesiastical Gothic, with a
graceful and well-proportioned tower and steeple, conspicuous from all points of view.</p>

<p>In <i>Hamilton</i>.&mdash;The court-house is in some respects the best designed of its kind
in Canada. The head office of the Canada Life Assurance Company is noteworthy
for its graceful simplicity, in its way not equalled in Canada.</p>

<p>In <i>Fredericton</i>.&mdash;The Church of England Cathedral, a perfect specimen, on a
small scale, of pure early English Gothic on the Continent.</p>

<p>The new library building which McGill University owes to the public spirit of
Mr. Redpath, of Montreal, is distinguished by the graceful simplicity of its external
form, and the conveniences of its beautiful interior. Apart from this fine edifice,
however, and the parliamentary library at Ottawa, whose external design is harmonious
and whose internal fittings illustrate the effectiveness of our natural woods,
Canada has no such libraries&mdash;in special buildings I mean&mdash;noteworthy for
beauty of architecture and convenience of arrangements as we find among our neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91&ndash;92</a></span>
illustrating their public and private spirit. Neither have we an art gallery of
special architectural features, for the building at Montreal is simple in the extreme.
Such as it is, however, it is an object of imitation to other cities in Canada.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
